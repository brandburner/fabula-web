  title: 'Lazarus Race: The Dead Man Who Changed the Map'
  description: 'A late-night TV panel dissects the surreal outcome in California''s
    47th — Horton Wilde, a recently deceased Democrat whose name stayed on the ballot,
    has made the traditionally Republican Orange County race competitive. The on-air
    exchange reframes the result as more than a curiosity: George and Julie voice
    disbelief while Martin ties the outcome to media moments, arguing debates materially
    shifted voters. The segment functions as a turning point: it converts an oddity
    into political momentum and heightens the pressure on Sam Seaborn''s looming,
    fraught decision to run.'

  - 'JULIE: "...and we still have-- I want to remind our viewers-- we still have three
    House races undecided as we''ve been reporting. Those would be Tennessee second,
    New York 22nd and the race that''s been dubbed Lazarus 47 in some circles, the
    race for California''s 47th Congressional District between the six-term incumbent
    Republican Chuck Webb and Democrat Horton Wilde who passed away some three weeks
    ago, but whose name remains on the ballot. George, which is stranger? That a Democrat
    is competitive in Orange County or that the Democrat in question is...? I don''t
    mean to make light of this of course, but the candidate passed away."'
  - 'GEORGE: "They''re both pretty strange Julie, but for a Democrat to win the 47th,
    he''s going to have to have something going for him, and this was it."'
  - 'MARTIN: "That''s how the President won."'

    description_of_involvement: 'Horton Wilde''s printed ballot name functions as
      the structural catalyst for the ''Lazarus 47'' story: the panel cites the fact
      that Wilde died but remained on the ballot, which directly created the competitive
      surprise in a Republican stronghold and fuels the on-air analysis.'
    status_before_event: Physically printed on paper ballots in California's 47th
      despite the candidate's death; dormant as an administrative artifact.
    status_after_event: Remains printed and legally valid on ballots; its narrative
      salience is amplified by media coverage and is now a talking point on national
      television.

  - object_uuid: ger_object_d46a469a4c51
    description_of_involvement: The label 'Lazarus 47' is deployed by the broadcast
      as a memorable hook; it condenses the oddity into a media meme and reframes
      a local curiosity into a digestible national storyline that invites further
      scrutiny and strategic reaction.
    status_before_event: Used informally among pundits and some media as a nickname
      for the California 47th contest.
    status_after_event: Amplified by the live broadcast into a broader narrative device,
      increasing its penetration among national viewers and political actors.

    description_of_involvement: The Northwest Lobby Television carries the late‑night
      panel into the West Wing; its live images and audio make the remote pundits'
      analysis immediate to staff, turning a studio conversation into an actionable
      alert for White House personnel.
    status_before_event: Tuned to live election coverage and displaying the panel
      discussion in the Lobby.
    status_after_event: Continues to broadcast the segment, having broadcast the decisive
      lines that reframe the 47th race and escalate the lobby's sense of urgency.

  - location_uuid: ger_location_4a16a9419e87
    description_of_involvement: 'California''s 47th Congressional District is the
      substantive battleground under discussion: its Orange County suburbs provide
      the political context that makes the result surprising and strategically consequential
      for national actors watching the broadcast.'
    observed_atmosphere: Portrayed as anomalous — a normally secure Republican district
      rendered unstable by an unusual ballot circumstance.
    functional_role: Object of analysis and the geographic locus for electoral upset.
    symbolic_significance: Represents the fragility of partisan strongholds when media
      moments and weird contingencies align.
    access_restrictions: ''
    key_environmental_details:
    - Identified as Orange County suburbia
    - Characterized as traditionally Republican territory turned competitive
    global_id: ger_location_4a16a9419e87
  - location_uuid: ger_location_3473f84f19dd
    description_of_involvement: The Northwest Lobby functions as the immediate theatrical
      space where the TV segment plays and is witnessed by staff — a communal nerve
      center where national media collides with executive operations, making pundit
      remarks felt as operational pressures.
    observed_atmosphere: 'Late‑night, quietly electric: television glow, murmured
      reactions, the sense of staff attention sharpening as results shift.'
    functional_role: Stage for public broadcast reception and catalytic site for instantaneous
      staff response.
    symbolic_significance: Embodies the porous boundary between media narrative and
      governance — where headlines become directives.
    access_restrictions: Generally public to West Wing staff and visitors; monitored
      but not sealed off in the scene.
    key_environmental_details:
    - Television glow illuminating faces
    - Murmured conversation and the implied presence of ringing phones
    - The open expanse of the lobby making the broadcast audible/visible to many

  organization_involvements:
  - organization_uuid: ger_organization_5278bcf2674a
    description_of_involvement: The Republican Party appears via the incumbent Chuck
      Webb and the expectation of holding Orange County seats; the broadcast frames
      the party as potentially vulnerable and challenged by unpredictable dynamics
      amplified by media narratives.
    active_representation: Implied by mentioning the Republican incumbent and by describing
      the district's partisan baseline.
    power_dynamics: Defensive — the party is portrayed as at risk of losing established
      ground, tested by an anomalous result becoming national fodder.
    organizational_goals:
    - Defend incumbency and shore up local organization to prevent seat loss.
    - Control the narrative to minimize the appearance of weakness.
    influence_mechanisms:
    - Local campaign infrastructure and incumbent advantages
    - Rapid local messaging and counter‑spin to media narratives
    institutional_impact: A perceived loss in a safe district stresses party messaging
      and can force strategic reallocations elsewhere.
    internal_dynamics: Pressure on local operatives and national strategists to respond
      quickly to unexpected vulnerability.
    global_id: ger_organization_5278bcf2674a
  - organization_uuid: ger_organization_552e6a998b3e
    description_of_involvement: The Democratic Party is implicated by the presence
      of Horton Wilde on the ballot and the idea that a Democratic name could flip
      a seat; the broadcast functions as a barometer for party fortunes and the possibility
      of unexpected gains.
    active_representation: Manifested through the candidate label and the narrative
      of an improbable Democratic edge in Orange County.
    power_dynamics: On the defensive/opportunistic — historically weaker in the district
      but potentially gaining leverage from unusual circumstances.
    organizational_goals:
    - Capitalize on surprise momentum to win a Congressional seat.
    - Translate media attention into practical electoral advantage in the special
      election that will follow.
    influence_mechanisms:
    - Messaging and media framing to amplify perceived momentum
    - Electoral organization and voter mobilization where possible
    institutional_impact: The event spotlights gaps in party resource allocation and
      how small shifts can affect broader balance of power.
    internal_dynamics: Tension between national narrative opportunities and local
      resource constraints (implied by how the race was previously deprioritized).
    global_id: ger_organization_552e6a998b3e
  - organization_uuid: ger_organization_e7a9e4ecbb31
    description_of_involvement: The U.S. House of Representatives is the institutional
      frame for the on-air references to 'three House races undecided' — the organization's
      balance of power is the implicit stake behind pundits' scrutiny of narrow contests
      like the 47th.
    active_representation: Represented indirectly through discussion of undecided
      House races and the stakes they create for national control.
    power_dynamics: The House is the prize whose possible shift pressures parties
      and the White House; its control exerts leverage over legislative outcomes.
    organizational_goals:
    - Maintain institutional stability by resolving contested races.
    - For its partisan components, secure or defend majority control.
    - Reduce uncertainty that complicates governance and legislative agenda.
    influence_mechanisms:
    - Electoral rules and seat counts determining majority control
    - Public perception shaped by media narratives about contested races
    institutional_impact: The segment highlights how a few close House races can alter
      legislative dynamics and drive rapid strategic responses from the White House
      and parties.
    internal_dynamics: Close races amplify inter‑party competition and force rapid
      resource and messaging decisions.

      Republican turf where a deceased Democrat's name still on ballots created an
      unlikely competitive test tied to national debate effects.
    observed_atmosphere: Implied local surprise and low-turnout oddity; the district
      is cast as anomalous and symbolically burdened by national optics.
    functional_role: Narrative battleground used to exemplify how local outcomes can
      reflect or be reframed by national moments.
    symbolic_significance: Represents the fragility of presumed partisan strongholds
      in the face of media-driven national narratives.
    access_restrictions: Standard electoral jurisdiction — open to registered voters
      and local media; not directly accessible in the scene.

    functional_role: Viewing hub and informal nerve center where media narratives
      become actionable intelligence for staff.

      executive action — how televised framing can intrude on governance.

      ballot and the pundits' reference to Democratic competitiveness.
    power_dynamics: Seen as gaining narrative momentum from national performances,
      though the party's local organizational decisions (e.g., resource allocation)

    power_dynamics: The party holds strategic weight and resources but must balance

    - Protect and, if possible, capitalize on the surprise victory to win the special
      election

  title: Casual Promise Becomes Midnight Political Firestorm
  description: 'Late in Toby''s office Sam tries to make sense of an improbable late-night
    Democratic victory by invoking an offhand Aristotle riff and then admits he told
    Horton Wilde''s widow he might run for her husband''s seat. Donna gently pushes
    him into the victory party where television reporters around the room transform
    a private, emotional promise into a headline: a rumor that Sam Seaborn will seek
    the vacant 47th District seat. The revelation instantly converts intimacy into
    public pressure, forcing Sam to scramble—calling Will and Kay and hunting down
    Toby, Josh and C.J.—and turning a personal favor into a decisive political crisis.'

  title: Casual Promise Becomes Midnight Political Firestorm
  description: 'Late in Toby''s office Sam tries to make sense of an improbable late-night
    Democratic victory by invoking an offhand Aristotle riff and then admits he told
    Horton Wilde''s widow he might run for her husband''s seat. Donna gently pushes
    him into the victory party where television reporters around the room transform
    a private, emotional promise into a headline: a rumor that Sam Seaborn will seek
    the vacant 47th District seat. The revelation instantly converts intimacy into
    public pressure, forcing Sam to scramble—calling Will and Kay and hunting down
    Toby, Josh and C.J.—and turning a personal favor into a decisive political crisis.'

      and candidate-selection pressure.
    internal_dynamics: Potential tension between honoring the deceased candidate's
      legacy and making pragmatic choices about who should run next; on-site staff

  title: 'Midnight Rumor: Sam''s Promise Goes Public'
  description: At Toby's office late at night, a private, offhand promise Sam made
    to a widow detonates into a public crisis when TV reporters announce an improbable
    Democratic victory in Orange County and a rumor that Sam will run for the vacant
    seat. Donna tries to lighten the moment with cake and pushes Sam toward the party,
    but the bulletin board-like authority of the television transforms personal loyalty
    into immediate political pressure. Sam scrambles—ordering staff to reach Will
    Bailey and Kay Wilde and hunting for Toby, Josh and C.J.—as the bullpen falls
    silent, marking a turning point that forces him to confront party expectations,
    career risk, and the cost of a well-meaning pledge.

    preferable to an improbable possibility." The impossible is preferable to the
    improbable.'
  - 'GAIL (on TV): ...the former Orange County resident and current White House Senior
    Advisor Sam Seaborn will seek the seat.'
  - 'SAM: Bonnie, Ginger, get me Will Bailey. Get me Kay Wilde very quickly, please.'

      Gail Mackee's on-site reporting channels the campaign's emotions and statements

  title: 'Midnight Rumor: Sam''s Promise Goes Public'
  description: At Toby's office late at night, a private, offhand promise Sam made
    to a widow detonates into a public crisis when TV reporters announce an improbable
    Democratic victory in Orange County and a rumor that Sam will run for the vacant
    seat. Donna tries to lighten the moment with cake and pushes Sam toward the party,
    but the bulletin board-like authority of the television transforms personal loyalty
    into immediate political pressure. Sam scrambles—ordering staff to reach Will
    Bailey and Kay Wilde and hunting for Toby, Josh and C.J.—as the bullpen falls
    silent, marking a turning point that forces him to confront party expectations,
    career risk, and the cost of a well-meaning pledge.

    active_representation: Implicitly through party strategists' expectations and
      the concern voiced by White House political staff; not represented by a single
      spokesman in the scene but present as pressure.
    power_dynamics: The Party is an influential arbiter that can marshal resources
      and expectations; it exerts pressure on individuals (like Sam) while also being
      vulnerable to missteps by its surrogates.
    organizational_goals:
    - Protect and, if possible, capture the California 47th seat in the special election.
    - Control the narrative and candidate selection process to maximize electoral
      advantage.

      surrogates.
    - Resource allocation (funding, field organization) and public signaling.
    institutional_impact: The Party's expectations convert a private promise into
      a public obligation, illustrating how individual gestures become entangled with

      targets of Sam's outreach as he seeks to clarify intent and obligations.
    active_representation: Through field staff and a live campaign party with reporters;
      Gail Mackee's on-site reporting channels the campaign's emotions and statements
      to the national media.
    power_dynamics: Locally authoritative over the Wilde name and base, but operationally
      dependent on external allies (e.g., prominent surrogates or the White House)
      for credibility and resources in a special election.
    organizational_goals:
    - Celebrate an improbable victory and consolidate supporter enthusiasm.
    - Decide and signal whether to endorse a particular surrogate candidate for the
      upcoming special election.
    influence_mechanisms:
    - Emotional momentum from supporters (social proof).
    - Media visibility via live events and field interviews.
    institutional_impact: The campaign's choice to continue under Wilde's name complicates
      succession norms and forces outside actors (like the White House) into reputational
      decisions tied to grief and loyalty.
    internal_dynamics: Tension between honoring the deceased's legacy and making pragmatic
      decisions about succession; staff (e.g., Will Bailey, Elsie Snuffin) negotiate
      loyalty versus strategic necessity.

  title: 'Midnight Rumor: Sam''s Promise Goes Public'
  description: At Toby's office late at night, a private, offhand promise Sam made
    to a widow detonates into a public crisis when TV reporters announce an improbable
    Democratic victory in Orange County and a rumor that Sam will run for the vacant
    seat. Donna tries to lighten the moment with cake and pushes Sam toward the party,
    but the bulletin board-like authority of the television transforms personal loyalty
    into immediate political pressure. Sam scrambles—ordering staff to reach Will
    Bailey and Kay Wilde and hunting for Toby, Josh and C.J.—as the bullpen falls
    silent, marking a turning point that forces him to confront party expectations,
    career risk, and the cost of a well-meaning pledge.

  title: 'Midnight Rumor: Sam''s Promise Goes Public'
  description: At Toby's office late at night, a private, offhand promise Sam made
    to a widow detonates into a public crisis when TV reporters announce an improbable
    Democratic victory in Orange County and a rumor that Sam will run for the vacant
    seat. Donna tries to lighten the moment with cake and pushes Sam toward the party,
    but the bulletin board-like authority of the television transforms personal loyalty
    into immediate political pressure. Sam scrambles—ordering staff to reach Will
    Bailey and Kay Wilde and hunting for Toby, Josh and C.J.—as the bullpen falls
    silent, marking a turning point that forces him to confront party expectations,
    career risk, and the cost of a well-meaning pledge.

    a private promise into a public crisis. TV anchors profile Sam and obsess over

    external expectations and political risk; Sam slams the door to stop his colleagues
    from scattering, seizing the moment and forcing an immediate, collective reckoning—a
    pivot from rumor to urgent decision point.

  title: Sam Stops the Exodus
  description: Sam arrives at C.J.'s office amid a growing media frenzy that has suddenly
    made his name a political story. As reporters air profiles and producers call
    about a possible presidential endorsement, Josh, C.J. and Toby move to consult
    the President. Sam slams the door, physically preventing them from dispersing.
    The gesture forces the team to confront the endorsement/run question together,

      block staff movement; its loud, forceful closure converts the off-screen panic
      into a contained, on-stage crisis and serves as a physical punctuation that
      stops dispersal.
    status_before_event: Open or opening as staff rise to leave C.J.'s office to consult
      the President.

      and where political triage occurs; it is the locus of immediate reaction to
      C.J.'s phone call and the place from which Josh moves to consult the President
      before Sam's intervention.
    observed_atmosphere: Busy and focused moments before Sam's interruption; quickly
      shifts to cramped urgency when staff are contained.
    functional_role: Staging ground for tactical political decisions and rapid coordination
      among senior staff.
    symbolic_significance: Embodies the engine room of political operations—where
      policy and panic collide.
    access_restrictions: Restricted to staff; high-traffic internal workspace.
    key_environmental_details:
    - Clustered desks and overlapping voices

    observed_atmosphere: Tension-filled and electrically charged with live television,
      ringing phones, and rapid footsteps.
    functional_role: Transitional staging area and public-facing pressure point that
      exposes the administration to media scrutiny.
    symbolic_significance: Represents the porous boundary between private White House
      deliberation and public political spectacle.
    access_restrictions: Publicly visible but monitored; security lingers at entrances,
      staff operate here routinely.

    description_of_involvement: 'The Democratic Party functions as background context:
      the unexpected strength in the traditionally Republican 47th fuels the media
      narrative and motivates staff concern about capitalizing or defending against
      political consequences.'
    active_representation: Manifested indirectly through commentators and the implications
      of the election result rather than a direct spokesman in the scene.
    power_dynamics: As the political institution whose fortunes are affected, it is
      both beneficiary and stakeholder in decisions about endorsements and candidate
      recruitment.
    organizational_goals:
    - Capitalize on unexpected electoral momentum in a traditionally hostile district
    - Protect party reputation by ensuring any candidate or endorsement is strategically
      sound
    influence_mechanisms:
    - Political expectations and party narrative that shape staff calculation
    - Informal networks and resource allocation contingent on candidate decisions
    institutional_impact: The party's potential gains create pressure on the White
      House to manage endorsements carefully, reflecting broader electoral strategy
      concerns.
    internal_dynamics: Tension between opportunistic expansion and resource/prioritization
      constraints likely informs behind-the-scenes calculus.

    description_of_involvement: ABC Nightly News is the originating organization for
      the outbound query (Sam Donaldson on the phone) and the televised profile; through
      its broadcast and direct producer calls, it transforms a local congressional
      curiosity into a national story and forces the White House to respond.
    active_representation: Via an on-air anchor and live producer phone calls requesting
      comment.
    power_dynamics: Exerts external pressure on the administration by shaping public
      narrative; wields agenda-setting power though lacks direct authority over White
      House decisions.
    organizational_goals:
    - Get on-the-record comment for a breaking story
    - Frame the night's narrative by profiling key figures tied to the unexpected
      result
    influence_mechanisms:
    - Live broadcast reach and framing
    - Direct producer-to-White-House phone calls creating immediacy and demand for
      comment
    institutional_impact: Highlights how media organizations can compel rapid institutional
      responses and force private deliberations into public view.

      on-the-record responses quickly.

    description_of_involvement: Gage, Whitney, Pace appears in Julie's TV profile
      as Sam's pre-White House employer, providing biographical texture that media
      use to explain Sam's credentials and potential electability; the firm is a narrative
      detail that complicates Sam's public image.
    active_representation: Represented on-air through biography and past-association
      references, not by a current spokesman.
    power_dynamics: Serves reputational influence rather than institutional power
      in this moment; its mention subjects Sam's private professional history to public
      scrutiny.
    organizational_goals:
    - (Implied) Maintain professional reputation through association when referenced
      in media
    - Remain a background detail that informs the public's perception of former employees
    influence_mechanisms:
    - Reputational association via media biography
    - The normative weight of elite professional credentials in voter and press perceptions
    institutional_impact: Signals how private-sector associations can become political
      liabilities or assets when a staffer is thrust into electoral contention.
    internal_dynamics: Not directly engaged; functions purely as background context
      in the narrative.

  title: Sam Stops the Exodus
  description: Sam arrives at C.J.'s office amid a growing media frenzy that has suddenly
    made his name a political story. As reporters air profiles and producers call
    about a possible presidential endorsement, Josh, C.J. and Toby move to consult
    the President. Sam slams the door, physically preventing them from dispersing.
    The gesture forces the team to confront the endorsement/run question together,
    shifting agency onto Sam and turning private panic into an immediate, collective
    crisis — a clear turning point that raises stakes and accelerates political pressure.

      the unexpected strength in the traditionally Republican 47th fuels the media
      narrative and motivates staff concern about capitalizing or defending against
      political consequences.'
    active_representation: Manifested indirectly through commentators and the implications
      of the election result rather than a direct spokesman in the scene.
    power_dynamics: As the political institution whose fortunes are affected, it is
      both beneficiary and stakeholder in decisions about endorsements and candidate
      recruitment.
    organizational_goals:
    - Capitalize on unexpected electoral momentum in a traditionally hostile district
    - Protect party reputation by ensuring any candidate or endorsement is strategically
      sound
    influence_mechanisms:
    - Political expectations and party narrative that shape staff calculation
    - Informal networks and resource allocation contingent on candidate decisions
    institutional_impact: The party's potential gains create pressure on the White
      House to manage endorsements carefully, reflecting broader electoral strategy
      concerns.

      curiosity into a national story and forces the White House to respond.
    active_representation: Via an on-air anchor and live producer phone calls requesting
      comment.
    power_dynamics: Exerts external pressure on the administration by shaping public
      narrative; wields agenda-setting power though lacks direct authority over White
      House decisions.

  title: Sam Frames the 'Candidacy' as a Promise
  description: Sam bursts into C.J.'s office and attempts to reframe the overnight
    rumor that he's running for the newly vacated seat as a well-meaning promise to
    a widow rather than personal ambition. He invokes Aristotle and praises Will Bailey
    and the improbable late-night Democratic victory to deflect credit, while Josh
    and Toby react with astonished disbelief. C.J. cuts through the rationalizing
    and immediately orders Sam to brief the President — turning a private promise
    into an urgent institutional problem and forcing an imminent political reckoning.

    Use my name, not thinking for a second it was ever going to be a practical option.'

  title: Midnight Promise — Celebration Interrupted by a Special Election
  description: 'Just after midnight, Bartlet and Abbey''s intimate victory moment
    is abruptly interrupted when Sam bursts in with urgent news: deceased congressman
    Horton Wilde has posthumously won the 47th, forcing a special election. A casual
    promise Sam made to Wilde''s widow has ballooned into a political expectation
    that Sam might be the Democratic nominee. Though Sam insists he isn’t running,
    the White House must confront questions of endorsement and optics. The scene compresses
    private tenderness and public duty—Bartlet offers immediate, personal support,
    Abbey''s pajama-clad entrance heightens the awkwardness, and Sam pivots into operational
    mode, tasking staff to reach Will Bailey and manage what could become a campaign.'

  title: 'Midnight Interrupt: A Private Bedside Reassurance Becomes a Political Pivot'
  description: 'A late-night, intimate celebration between President Bartlet and Abbey
    is abruptly reframed as Sam Seaborn delivers unexpected political news: Horton
    Wilde has posthumously won the 47th, triggering a special election. Sam, embarrassed
    and defensive about a promise he made to the widow, tries to minimize his role
    even as Bartlet offers full, immediate support. Abbey''s pajama entrance heightens
    the awkward domesticity as the moment shifts from personal warmth to campaign
    triage—Sam exits, instructing staff to reach Will Bailey, setting up a key turning
    point about duty, promise, and political pressure.'

    description_of_involvement: The White House Victory Party is the contextual origin
      of the night's celebration and the backdrop for the television-fed narrative
      that amplifies the 47th's surprising result. Though offstage during this moment,
      its televised atmosphere feeds the urgency and rumor-momentum that push staff
      to respond.
    observed_atmosphere: Celebratory and screen-lit in tone—cheerful yet vulnerable
      to rapid shifts as returns and punditry reshape narratives.
    functional_role: Source of the public-facing momentum and media attention that
      turns a local result into national pressure.
    symbolic_significance: Symbolizes the public arena that intrudes on private moments;
      the party's screens and chatter are the vector by which rumor becomes crisis.
    access_restrictions: Open to staff and press within controlled White House parameters.
    key_environmental_details:
    - Televisions broadcasting election returns and pundit commentary
    - People clustered with cake and drink, reacting to on-screen news

    description_of_involvement: 'The Democratic Party is the institutional backdrop:
      its candidate (Horton Wilde) and local operations created the opening for a
      posthumous win and the subsequent scramble to defend a contested seat. The party''s
      interests inform the urgency around an endorsement, staffing decisions, and
      messaging control in the first hours after returns.'
    active_representation: Manifested implicitly through staff activity and the need
      for rapid outreach to local operatives and potential surrogates; represented
      through the President's and aides' concern for party optics.
    power_dynamics: The party exerts pressure on individual actors to protect a winnable
      seat while also constrained by local organizational failures and limited immediate
      control—creating a top-down expectation but bottom-up fragility.
    organizational_goals:
    - To retain the 47th seat in the special election
    - To quickly identify and manage an acceptable surrogate or candidate
    - To control the narrative and avoid chaotic public speculation
    influence_mechanisms:
    - Use of endorsements and public support to shape voter and donor perception
    - Mobilization of staff and resources to local operatives
    - Reputational pressure and expectations placed on high-profile party figures
    institutional_impact: Reveals tensions between national party expectations and
      local campaign fragility; exposes how past strategic decisions (e.g., resource
      allocation) can produce late-night crises.
    internal_dynamics: 'Implied internal strain: debate over resource allocation,
      chain-of-command urgency, and potential disagreement about candidate selection
      and messaging strategy.'
