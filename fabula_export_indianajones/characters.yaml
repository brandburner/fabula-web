  canonical_name: Abner Ravenwood
  title_role: null
  description: Abner Ravenwood — Marion Ravenwood's father — was the eccentric, obsessive
    owner of The Raven saloon (noted in some accounts as located in Patan, Nepal).
    Over time he became fixated on his artifact collection, sold pieces off during
    a period described as 'snow madness,' and ultimately bequeathed the bar to Marion.
    He was also an elusive figure who drew the attention of Army Intelligence in relation
    to artifact recovery, a pursuit that links him to Indiana Jones' world. His disappearance
    and reported death in an avalanche left a tragic legacy that shaped Marion's approach
    to running the establishment and fueled continuing narrative investigations.

  canonical_name: Adolf Hitler
  title_role: Führer
  description: Adolf Hitler directs Nazi Germany's pursuit of biblical artifacts like
    the Ark of the Covenant. Musgrove describes his fixation on the occult as fanatical,
    driving intelligence efforts toward Tanis and the Staff of Ra headpiece. Eaton
    links this obsession to Hitler's belief in the Ark's destructive power. Belzig
    salutes him rigidly, affirming his status as the regime's ultimate authority and
    ideological center. These references position Hitler as the quest's distant but
    decisive motivator, blending personal mania with national military ambition.

  description: Amir serves as a local elder and script expert aiding Sallah and Indiana
    Jones in their pursuit of the Ark. In Sallah's truck outside an Arab bar, the
    raspy-voiced old man with crooked fingers closely examines the broken headpiece
    medallion. He traces its markings, deciphers the exact staff height needed to
    locate the Well of Souls, reveals Belloq's seven-and-a-half-inch miscalculation
    that sends the Nazis to the wrong dig site, and issues a grave warning against
    disturbing the Ark. His calm delivery turns grief into tactical advantage before
    he resumes sipping his wine.

    dodges match the humans' jumps into doorways, heightening the chase's chaos and
    risk to city life. Instinct drives their evasion, preserving them amid the high-stakes
    pursuit while underscoring Indy's razor-thin control over the truck.

    then places a fresh, expensive one sent by the gentleman in the corner—Emile Belloq—and
    relays the invitation to join him. He notices the three German henchmen surrounding

    Indiana Jones's tense confrontation with Belloq and German henchmen. They start
    indifferent, eyes on their own drinks as foreigners maneuver. Sallah's children
    burst in, and the patrons snap to attention, shifting toward concealed weapons
    in a ripple of alert menace. Belloq notices and signals his men to ease off. Their

    through a cramped train tunnel lit by lanterns. The group advances slowly up the
    irregular passage, 7 feet wide on average, ducking under support beams that drop
    the height to 4.5 feet every 40 feet. They trail the Ark ahead where Shliemann
    eyes it with worry and Belloq watches with excitement. This team handles the delicate
    transport toward Berlin, navigating physical constraints that mirror the leaders'
    tense debate over ritual versus military use.

    a key beat—carry Marion bound in a large rattan basket (and later use a decoy
    basket loaded with contraband weapons). Two of them specifically appear as courier/decoy
    operatives who hustle the basket across a square, coordinate with a German agent
    covering the truck retreat, and are knocked down by Indy''s whip, spilling the

  description: Captain Simon Katanga commands the tramp steamer Bantu Wind out of
    Cairo. He is an observant, authoritative shipmaster who watches Indiana Jones
    and Marion Ravenwood before their voyage, and later, under the threat of Nazi
    pursuit and approaching submarines, orders them below for cover. Faced with armed
    boarding parties on his bridge, Katanga mixes protective quick thinking with desperate
    commercial pragmatism—declaring Jones dead and attempting to barter Marion to
    recoup losses and save his ship. His role across these scenes marks him as a composed
    but pragmatic maritime authority caught between duty to passengers and the hard
    realities of piracy and commerce.
