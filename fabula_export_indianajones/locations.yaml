  canonical_name: Abandoned Excavation at Tanis Digs
  description: Indy and Marion crouch in this shaded pit amid the Tanis Digs, dust
    settling around them as they peer toward the nearby airstrip. The abandoned excavation
    offers crucial concealment for their stakeout of the Nazi Flying Wing, engines
    distant but tension immediate. Shadows cloak their watch until discovery forces
    them into the open, turning safety into peril near roaring propellers and spilled
    fuel.

  description: Exposed rooftop perches high over the Map Room at the Tanis dig site,
    daylight beating down on scattered ropes and oil drums amid swirling dust. Sallah
    fingers a line here, feigning calm as German soldiers bark orders and yank him
    toward a stuck jeep, his fearful glance piercing back through the skylight to
    the action below. Indy emerges gasping from that same skylight, ducks behind cover
    while Sallah hauls in their escape rope, both men edging toward enemy tents under
    constant threat of detection. Tension crackles in the open air, every shout from
    guards forcing split-second subservience and improvisation.

  canonical_name: Adjacent Cabin
  description: This cabin sits next door to Indy's quarters on the ship, linked by
    a simple interior door that allows Marion to slip through during their nighttime
    reunion. The space implies cramped maritime confines—wood-paneled walls, a narrow
    bunk, and the gentle rock of ocean waves outside. Marion emerges from here in
    her prim white nightgown, carrying the quiet intimacy of shared passage amid the
    vessel's nocturnal hush, bridging their cabins into a single emotional territory.

  canonical_name: Aisle of Display Cases
  description: Narrow aisle in Hok’s Marrakesh museum lined with glass cases holding
    ancient artifacts under dim light. Indiana Jones pauses here to study a gilded
    headpiece’s carvings and staff hollow. A samurai charges its length, shattering
    the quiet; Indy fires once, then dodges as a second blade knocks his pistol away
    and nearly severs his fingers. He uncoils his bullwhip for a tense duel amid gleaming
    treasures and lethal shadows.

  description: Narrow daytime alley presses against Hok’s Museum rear wall, marked
    by a fresh hole that Kehoe conceals with a pushed trash container—calm cover for
    forensic delay. The overhanging roof serves as launch for Indy’s desperate leap
    onto a slowly rolling Ford sedan; aged metal screeches as his legs punch through
    the roof into the passenger space, sparking chaos and flight. Gritty confines

    a deep, snake-filled pit. Torchlight flickers across carved hieroglyphic pillars
    as Indiana Jones and Sallah climb the platform, pry off the altar's heavy lid
    and reveal the Ark of the Covenant. The Ark's unearthly glow repels the writhing
    asps that carpet the 30-foot pit; serpents recoil from the raised zone while torches,
    oil, ropes, and jeering enemies frame the tense retrieval and crating of the artifact.

    there, flanked by German henchmen, as their talk turns from taunts about Marion
    to the Ark's power as a transmitter to God. Tension peaks until Sallah's children
    swarm in, shouting and shoving patrons to create chaos for Indy's escape. Outside,
    Sallah's truck parks directly in front, tying the bar to the night's desperate

    Wurrfler across choppy daytime seas. Katanga and his pirate crew plant themselves
    here, shoulders squared, and fire defiant salutes at the sub's conning tower.
    Deck planks groan under their boots as they hold position, mere yards from the
    periscope's cold gaze and a captain's finger hovering over the torpedo controls.
    Salt spray stings faces amid the standoff's electric hush, where one command could

    shoulder the heavy Ark crate under rifle muzzles while Nazis sweep the area, hauling
    Marion from her cabin amid jeers as Indy bolts up the steps and slips into shadow.

    the intercepted Cairo communique and seat of higher command whose impatience spurs
    Shliemann's aggression. Shliemann cites it as the place where their prize—the
    Ark—awaits the Führer, fueling Nazi zeal across distant digs. Belloq proposes
    opening the Ark there for verification, highlighting tensions between ritual reverence

    dislodges a pillar to smash through the ancient wall. He plummets into its depths
    amid the chaos of dying torches and encroaching snakes, then reemerges with whip
    in hand to haul a terrified Marion through the jagged breach. The chamber's unseen
    hazards test Indy's grit, turning desperate imprisonment into raw escape amid

  description: A deep, silent black pit opens beneath the dust-covered cobwebs masking
    the false floor in the Sanctuary Foyer. Indy tests the void by dropping a stone
    that produces no sound, confirming its bottomless depth. He anchors his whip to
    a beam overhead, swings across the chasm, and extends the line as a lifeline.
    Satipo crosses gripping the whip while dust motes drift in faint sunlit shafts
    above the lethal drop, where a fall promises certain death. This central hazard

    domes pierce the skyline and then give way to narrow alleys choked with chaotic
    bazaars. Fierce men in galabiyas jostle veiled women and barefoot children through
    dense crowds, creating anonymity that hides pursuits and deceptions. In this narrative
    the city is also the site of Nazi operations—communiqués to Berlin, the trucking
    and loading of the Ark, and planning for flights out—so its visual panoramas (the
    ancient skyline) and claustrophobic streets jointly establish atmosphere and plot

  description: Indy leaps from a riverside cliff into the water surface at dusk, swims
    hard to the amphibious plane taxiing atop it, and hauls aboard as engines roar
    free from pursuers. Swells slap across the submarine periscope at night, jolting
    him awake; the craft dives below the calm expanse, prompting his jacket-shielded
    plunge into chilly depths. These fluid barriers demand raw physicality and split-second
    adaptation amid relentless threats.

  canonical_name: Well of Souls Entry Aperture
  description: 'Jagged aperture in the ancient tomb roof forming the sole access to
    the Well of Souls: a 30-foot plunge into a vast underground chamber alive with
    thousands of asps. Indy and Sallah lean over the breach as torches and oil are
    lowered (and Indy swings on a rope), the light revealing hieroglyph-lined walls,
    supporting pillars, a central altar left clear of snakes, and a tall stone pillar
    that grazes the cavern ceiling. Dust-choked air, flickering flames, and the heat
    and hissing of the serpent-infested pit characterize the entry; Sallah manages
    equipment and crates through the narrow opening while the torch-lined descent
    becomes the team''s planned approach.'

  canonical_name: Well of the Souls
  description: A subterranean temple chamber known as the Well of the Souls whose
    floor is carpeted by a six-inch-deep, writhing sea of venomous snakes. The mass
    of serpents piles, broods eggs, releases hatchlings and devours one another in
    shadowed chaos. In the key narrative sequence Indy descends into the chamber,
    brushes a fragile pillar, pours parallel oil lines across the snakes and ignites
    them to blaze a narrow six-foot path toward the distant altar while Sallah follows
    through smoke and hissing reptiles.

  canonical_name: Wurrfler
  description: The Wurrfler looms as a Nazi transport ship moored close to the Bantu
    Wind, its deck the ordered destination for soldiers carrying the crated Ark aboard
    under Shliemann's commands. Nazi efficiency drives the transfer amid tense standoffs
    on the nearby bridge, where Belloq watches with reverent hunger and Captain Katanga
    barters Marion in defeat. Gray steel hulls and barked orders fill the air with
    cold bureaucratic triumph, the vessel claiming the artifact and escalating Indy's
    pursuit into enemy territory.

  canonical_name: Wurrfler Conning Tower (submarine turret)
  description: The conning tower / turret of the Nazi submarine Wurrfler — the raised
    periscope-and-bridge structure that both protrudes into the sub base docking bay
    during Ark unloading and later serves as Indy's precarious hold as the sub dives.
    The feature is characterized by an exposed periscope that Indy uses to hide and
    secure himself with his whip, the captain and bridge crew (including tensions
    with Shliemann) immediately below, and the changing conditions around it (ceremonial
    unloading/dockside bustle versus dive klaxons, flooding decks, and rolling seas).

  canonical_name: Wurrfler's Aft Main Deck Rail
  description: Indy grabs the aft rail first, slick with seawater as the Wurrfler
    dives. Flooding deck surges around his legs; he hauls his soaked body aboard,
    hat lost to waves, metal bites into hands amid the sub's tilt. This rear edge
    serves as desperate foothold, channeling raw survival against Nazi U-boat's plunge—salt
    spray stings, water roars, every grip tests resolve before he climbs to turret.
