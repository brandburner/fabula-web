      title: Genesis of the Daleks Part 1
      written_by: Terry Nation
      logline: When the Time Lords foresee the Daleks' rise to galactic dominance,
        they send the Doctor, Sarah, and Harry back to Skaro to prevent their creation
        or alter their genetic development, forcing them to navigate a brutal war
        and confront Davros, the twisted scientist behind the Daleks.
      high_level_summary: |-
        The Time Lords, concerned about the Daleks' potential to dominate the universe, intercept the Fourth Doctor and his companions, Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan, and send them to Skaro during a bitter war between the Kaleds and the Thals. The Doctor and his companions find themselves in the middle of a war of attrition fought with a mix of primitive and advanced weaponry, a war that has ravaged the planet and created mutated beings known as Mutos who live in the wastelands.

        After landing on Skaro, the Doctor, Sarah, and Harry are quickly caught in the crossfire and encounter soldiers from both sides. They are eventually captured by the Kaleds and taken to their command center. There, they meet General Ravon, who is struggling to maintain his war effort with dwindling resources. The Doctor uses his wit and ingenuity to escape with Harry, taking Ravon hostage. Meanwhile, Sarah becomes separated from the Doctor and Harry, wandering through the war-torn landscape.

        As the Doctor and Harry attempt to find their way back to the TARDIS, they are pursued by Kaled security forces led by Nyder, a ruthless and ambitious officer. They soon realize that the war is not what it seems. The Kaleds are not fighting for survival but for the advancement of a twisted ideology centered around racial purity and the elimination of all "imperfects," including the Mutos. Nyder, loyal to Davros, is focused on securing equipment and supplies for Davros' secret bunker.

        Sarah encounters the Mutos and discovers their tragic origins as victims of chemical warfare. She also stumbles upon Davros' hidden bunker, where she witnesses the horrifying birth of the Daleks. Davros, a crippled and fanatical Kaled scientist, has genetically engineered the Daleks from the Kaled race, stripping them of all emotions except hatred and a desire to exterminate.

        Captured again, the Doctor and Harry are taken to Davros' bunker as well; the Doctor confronts Davros about his dangerous ambitions. Davros sees the Daleks as the ultimate form of life, programmed for total domination. The Doctor is horrified by Davros' creation and recognizes the immense threat the Daleks pose to the universe.

        As the story unfolds (in later episodes), the Doctor must decide whether he has the right to destroy the Daleks and prevent their genesis, or if he should allow them to exist and face the consequences. His actions will determine the fate of Skaro and the future of the universe.

      logline: When the Doctor and his companion find themselves on the war-torn planet
        Skaro, they must decide whether or not to prevent the genesis of the Daleks,
        monstrous creatures destined to become one of the greatest evils in the universe.

      logline: When the Time Lords send the Doctor to prevent the Daleks' creation,
        he confronts moral dilemmas of genocide as he infiltrates a war-torn Kaled
        city and faces Davros, the scientist responsible for engineering the Dalek
        race, deciding the fate of the universe.
      high_level_summary: |-
        On assignment from the Time Lords, the Doctor, along with Harry and Sarah, is sent to the planet Skaro during the Kaled-Thal war, tasked with preventing the genesis of the Daleks or mitigating their future threat.

        Skaro is mired in a seemingly endless war between the Kaleds and the Thals. The Kaleds, mutated and nearing their final form, are led by the brilliant but ruthless scientist Davros, who seeks to engineer the perfect life form to survive the planet’s harsh conditions. Davros has been genetically engineering his own race to remove their weaknesses and create a superior, emotionless being, encased in a metallic shell, known as the Daleks. The Doctor discovers the horrific experiments and ethical implications of Davros's work; he sees that the Daleks' inherent drive for domination will spread tyranny across the universe.

        Captured by Davros, The Doctor is forced to reveal future Dalek defeats, information Davros integrates into the Dalek programming. Meanwhile, a faction of Kaled scientists plots against Davros, fearing his Dalek project has spiraled out of control. Gharman, the leader of the dissident Kaled scientists, organizes a rebellion against Davros, believing the Dalek project has perverted the Kaled's original goals. The Doctor warns them of Davros’s foresight and potential trap, but they proceed, undeterred.

        As the Thal army prepares a final assault on the Kaled dome, the Doctor contemplates his mission. He struggles with the decision to commit genocide, weighing the potential destruction of an entire species against the countless lives the Daleks would eventually destroy. He gains access to the incubation room where the first Daleks are being developed. Resolved, the Doctor plants explosives, intending to wipe out the Daleks in their infancy. But ultimately hesitates, questioning the morality of his actions.

        Davros, aware of the growing rebellion, seemingly capitulates, offering to listen to the demands of the scientific and military elite. However, this is a ruse. As the rebel leaders gather to present their ultimatum, Davros reveals his true plan: a new breed of Daleks loyal only to him. Simultaneously, the Doctor prepares to detonate the explosives in the incubation room, but finds himself unable to commit the act of genocide. Before he can decide, he's pulled from the room by an angry, newly-formed Dalek.

        Ultimately, the Doctor, Harry, and Sarah escape, leaving the Kaled dome amidst chaos and destruction. The Kaled rebellion has begun, and the Thal army makes their final assault. The Doctor, though failing to erase the Daleks from existence, sows the seeds of their future conflicts and imperfections, ensuring they are not an unstoppable force. The Thal army advances on the Kaled dome.

      logline: The Doctor, sent by the Time Lords to avert the creation of the Daleks,
        confronts Davros on war-torn Skaro; torn between destroying the Daleks and
        the potential consequences of their absence, he must decide the fate of the
        universe.
      high_level_summary: |-
        On the war-ravaged planet Skaro, the Time Lords send the Doctor, Sarah Jane Smith, and Harry Sullivan to prevent the genesis of the Daleks. They arrive amidst a conflict between the Kaleds and the Thals, manipulated by the scientist Davros. Davros, the creator of the Daleks, seeks to engineer the ultimate life form, devoid of compassion and driven by ruthless aggression, to ensure the Kaled's survival through domination.

        The Doctor grapples with the moral implications of genocide, questioning his right to wipe out an entire species, even one destined for evil. He fears that by destroying the Daleks, he would become no better than them, a chilling parallel to Davros's ambition.

        As Davros presents his Dalek project to the Kaled Elite, aiming to secure their backing for mass production, Gharman, a dissenting voice, proposes an alternative where the Kaled mutation follows a natural course, retaining both good and evil. Davros dismisses this, advocating for a merciless, superior race.

        Meanwhile, the Thals, led by Bettan, plan to destroy the Kaled bunker, the heart of the Dalek project, even at the risk of entombing everyone inside. Sevrin, a Thal soldier, ventures into the bunker hoping to warn the Doctor and his companions.

        The Doctor, Sarah, and Harry infiltrate Davros's operations, pursued by Davros's loyalist, Nyder. They manage to destroy a crucial tape recording containing Davros's genetic manipulation data, preventing the completion of his original vision. However, the Doctor loses the Time Ring, their means of escape, forcing them to find another way out.

        Davros, cornered, unleashes the first Daleks on the Kaled Elite, massacring those who opposed him, including Gharman and Kravos. As the Thals detonate explosives at the bunker's entrance and Dalek production begins autonomously, chaos erupts. Nyder attempts to align with the Daleks, but is exterminated for his disloyalty. The Doctor, separated from Sarah and Harry, returns to the incubation room with plans to detonate explosives, delaying the Dalek's genesis by a millennium. They escape with Sevrin by the nick of time, leaving Davros to face his creations.

        The Daleks, rejecting Davros's control, declare themselves superior and exterminate him and the remaining Elite, announcing their mission to dominate the universe. The Doctor, Sarah, and Harry use the Time Ring to escape as the bunker collapses, leaving the Daleks entombed but far from destroyed, their reign of terror merely delayed.
