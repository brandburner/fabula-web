    war machine in Skaro's Kaled bunker. This armored unit encases a Kaled mutant,
    granting independent mobility, voice responsiveness, and accurate targeting. It

    until interrupted, and broadcasts Davros's retreat command amid the Thal assault.
    It patrols trenches, enforces bunker security, assumes full military duties, and
    affirms orders to hunt prisoners and eliminate traitors. Absolute obedience to
    Davros propels its role in evolving Kaled forces toward universal genocide.

    the Kaled-Thal war on Skaro. These armored machines, forged as part of Davros's

    guns. They obey Davros without question and are deployed in *Genesis of the Daleks*
    (Parts 1-4) to enforce his vision of universal supremacy. Key actions include
    executing scientist Ronson, ambushing Thals, pursuing the Doctor and Bettan, and
    stalking trenches under Skaro's red skies. These prototypes mark the transition
    of the Kaled species into the Dalek race, distinct from the Time Lord Emissary

Composed of key leaders such as Mogran and Ravon, they function as both a political and military authority, overseeing strategic decisions and scientific initiatives. The Councillors convene in a strategy room to deliberate on critical matters, often excluding observers, and are characterized by their cautious, bureaucratic, and divided nature. Their deliberations are marked by procedural rigidity and internal divisions, particularly regarding the unchecked power of Davros and the Dalek project.

      Despite urgent warnings from the Doctor and Harry Sullivan about the dangers of Davros's experiments, the Councillors respond with indifference and complacency. They order a temporary suspension of the experiments pending investigation—a half-measure that fails to fully halt Davros's work and underscores their reluctance to take decisive action. Their cautious approach maintains a fragile truce with the Thals but ultimately enables Davros's continued influence and the progression of the Dalek project.

  description: 'Ronson works as a senior researcher in the Kaled Science Division
    inside Skaro''s elite bunker. He questions captured intruders like the Doctor
    and Harry with initial skepticism. Davros''s Dalek prototypes spark his moral
    crisis: he hesitates, trembles, disables machinery to shield the Doctor, confesses
    the eugenics shift on mutated Kaleds, shares escape routes, and admits lapses
    that let Sarah Jane Smith and Sevrin flee. He hopes they convince Kaled leaders
    to halt Davros. Davros later brands him a Thal spy and commands the new Daleks
    to execute him. Ronson pleads for mercy as their first victim.'
