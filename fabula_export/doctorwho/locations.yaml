  canonical_name: Bomb Crater
  description: Jagged scar in Skaro's battered battlefield ground offers scant shelter
    to the Doctor, Sarah, and Harry as artillery shells scream overhead in a creeping
    barrage. Earth trembles with each blast; smoke chokes the air thick with cordite
    and dust. Inside lies a dead Kaled soldier, gas mask askew, radiation detector
    dangling—his twisted form warns of the war's relentless grind. The trio huddles
    here, breaths shallow, every second a gamble against the next explosion.

  canonical_name: Cave at the Edge of the Wasteland (Kaled Detention Escape Route)
  description: A dark, cavernous chamber at the fringe of Skaro's wasteland, accessible
    via the Kaled detention room's ventilation ducts. This space serves as a critical
    escape route for prisoners fleeing the Kaled bunker system. It is infested with
    Davros' grotesque genetic experiments—failed mutations that still twitch and moan—creating
    an atmosphere of raw horror. The slick walls amplify unnatural cries, and fetid
    air carries the stench of mutation. Narrow passages force escapees to navigate
    past these living relics of Davros' ambition, confronting the ethical weight of
    intervening in Dalek genesis. The cave's dim light and primal snarls heighten
    the isolation and danger of the escape, marking it as a pivotal location in the
    moral crisis of *Genesis of the Daleks*.

    and pursuit. The Doctor disarms Nyder after a brutal struggle in one of these
    corridors, presses him against the wall for a tense interrogation that yields
    the tape's location. Companions crouch in shadows to evade screeching Daleks,
    hearts pounding as Sevrin guides them toward the main entrance. A specific corridor
    outside Davros' office serves as a site of frantic struggle where the Doctor drops
    the Time Ring amid chaos. Alarms blare, footsteps echo off scarred metal walls,
    and desperation builds during frantic sprints to outrun the detonation. Dust chokes

    trembling corridors toward it, dust choking the air and debris crashing down.
    Davros deploys Dalek patrols to lock it down as a maximum-security zone, their
    mechanical patrols echoing off reinforced walls. A Thal detonation later buries
    the exit under rubble for 1,000 yards, slamming shut any hope of flight and sealing
    the Daleks inside their tomb.

    and Assembly Hall** (where green light bathes Dalek mutants in fluid tanks, and
    the first operational Daleks emerge to exterminate dissenters Gharman, Kravos,
    and Nyder before turning on Davros), and other key facilities. The bunker shields
    against Thal assaults, with steel corridors echoing Kaled Elite debates, Dalek
    extermination shrieks, and the ominous tick of planted explosives. The Doctor
    detonates explosives, forcing premature Dalek emergence amid weapon fire, collapsing
    walls, and chaos. The complex becomes a tomb of moral collapse as Thals trigger
    its collapse, entombing creators and creatures alike in rubble.

  canonical_name: Kaled City Under the Dome (Primary Habitat Dome)
  description: The Kaled City Under the Dome is the primary exposed habitat dome on
    Skaro's scarred surface, located four miles from the fortified underground bunker.
    Kaleds inhabit this dome amid constant bombardment from Thals, its shell vulnerable
    compared to the bunker's deep protection. The dome serves as the political and
    strategic heart of Kaled society, housing the Kaled Council Chamber (where leaders
    like Mogran and Ravon preside) and anchoring Kaled politics. Soldiers cite it
    as a strategic target reachable by hidden service tunnels toward Davros's labs,
    where gas attacks leave propped corpses. The dome's vulnerability and the complacency
    of its leaders (e.g., Mogran's secret meeting against Davros) heighten threats
    to Davros's isolated laboratory power base. The dome's fate is tied to the genesis
    of the Daleks and the war between Kaleds and Thals.

    A fortified Kaled military stronghold built for war, serving as both a **command headquarters** (central hub for strategic coordination, threat processing, and frontline reports) and a **command complex** (patrolled by guards, featuring scarred corridors, lifts like Platform Seven, and a tense, humid atmosphere). The facility is under siege during the Kaled-Thal war, with General Ravon overseeing operations. It is characterized by:
            - **Dual functional roles**: Acts as a **command center** (coordinating alerts, radio chatter, and strategic decisions) and a **fortified complex** (patrolled corridors, lifts, and close-quarters pursuits).
            - **Atmosphere**: Humid, echoing, and tense, with guards pursuing intruders and comms alerts locking down sections.
            - **Key features**: Platform Seven (a lift offering false hope), scarred corridors (where the Doctor and Harry traverse labyrinthine passages under Ravon's wary guard), and bunkered channels for communication.
            - **Leadership**: General Ravon exercises authority, while Nyder’s guards enforce security.
            - **Narrative significance**: The corridors are a claustrophobic maze where tense standoffs with Ravon and Nyder escalate into gunfire, forcing a desperate sprint toward Platform Lift Seven.

    huddle, breaths ragged from the scuffle, Nyder's defiance cracking under pressure.
    The space traps the corridor's chaos—echoing footsteps outside, stale air thick
    with sweat and fear—offering only a heartbeat's respite before Sevrin interrupts.
    This utilitarian bolt-hole serves as a fragile sanctuary against pursuit, marked
    by bare walls and sparse furnishings in the labyrinthine laboratory complex.

  description: Skaro endures as a war-ravaged planet locked in endless Kaled-Thal
    conflict, its surface cratered by artillery, laced with minefields, and scoured
    by toxic winds. The trenches—muddy, rot-infested battlefields—are where Thal fighters
    like Commander Bettan and Muto Sevrin face off over assault timing, laying bare
    the resistance’s desperation. These trenches, along with the wastelands and caves,
    form the planet’s brutal landscape, where the Doctor forges pacts with Sevrin
    for Thal diversions amid the ceaseless slog of war. Every shadow in the trenches
    breeds betrayal, and survival hinges on outpacing the Daleks’ rise.

  description: |2-

          The **Thal Dome** is a claustrophobic, radiation-saturated chamber on Skaro, trapping slaves in a massive rocket silo where they are forced to load unshielded distronic explosive cylinders into the rocket's nose cone. The dome encompasses:
          1. **The Rocket Loading Bay**: The base of the rocket inside the dome, where slaves (including Sarah Jane Smith, Sevrin, and Mutos) load explosives under Thal guard supervision. This area features a **wall-mounted toxic level monitor**, an **electric buggy** for cylinder delivery, and a **claustrophobic atmosphere** underscoring the Thals' genocidal scheme.
          2. **Interior Labor Spaces**: Dimly lit areas where slaves endure forced labor, with interactions involving guard oversight and the growing horror of the toxic environment.
          3. **Sub-Locations**: Includes specific areas like the **Slave Rest Room** (for recovery) and the **Dome Surface** (exterior escape target), though these are distinct from the primary loading bay.

          The dome's **overarching purpose** is to serve as the **center of Thal genocidal operations**, where slaves are poisoned by toxaemia while building the rocket that will destroy them. The **Rocket Loading Bay** is the **core functional area** of the dome, where the majority of slave labor and narrative tension occur.

The corridor is characterized by dim lighting, the tramp of patrolling Thal guards in bulky protective suits, and a tense atmosphere of secrecy and urgency. Key features include:
            - **Doorway**: A specific entry point where the Doctor and Harry hide while a guard's entry masks their movement past patrols.
            - **Ventilation grill**: Used for eavesdropping on Davros's threats from the sealed chamber.
            - **Liminal zone**: Serves as a transit point between Thal and Kaled domains, filled with echoes of footsteps, the clank of stolen equipment, and the ever-present threat of discovery.
            - **High-stakes events**: Includes ambushes of Thal guards, the Doctor impersonating a spy to steal protective suits, and the corridor's role as a transit point before the impending chemical attack.

  description: A dimly lit chamber deep within the Thal war camp/dome on Skaro, serving
    as a high-stakes negotiation space between Davros, Nyder, and the Thal Councillor.
    The room hosts tense discussions where Davros manipulates the Thal into accepting
    a chemical formula designed to wipe out the Kaleds (unwittingly accelerating Dalek
    creation). The antechamber/corridor outside this chamber is a critical listening
    post where the Doctor and Harry Moffat eavesdrop on the negotiations, with narrow
    spaces, shadows, and thick bunker air forcing them into tight cover. The location
    serves as a crucible for genocidal schemes, with every creak and echo risking
    their exposure in this high-stakes moment of Skaro's endless conflict. Concrete
    floors echo with footsteps, walls bear scars of prolonged war, and shadows amplify
    the urgency of the scene.
