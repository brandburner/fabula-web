  description: Liz's home at 29 Mernell St. houses a cramped kitchen cluttered with
    frozen bread loaves that slice fingers, mini-pizzas doled out on magazines in
    place of plates, and dish towels taped into bandages. Tight counters force bodies
    close during crises, where taxi calls replace ambulances and hunger frays nerves.

  description: Amanda's residential flat, which she rents out via Airbnb, is occupied

    themselves out and thereby strand Amanda from the space. This incident precipitates
    an urgent childcare request at the local café and exposes tensions between using
    the property for income and managing family responsibilities; the locked-out interior
    (cozy, unseen) functions as a narrative catalyst in the mums' social dynamics.

    off Amanda's front door, his phone call cutting short any welcome. He points down
    impatiently, herding them into the basement below while barely acknowledging Julia's
    introduction. The group trudges down wooden steps from the entryway, the descent

    to Julia, and slamming the door as Julia is expelled from the alpha‑mum network.

    ''Alpha Table'' (breastfeeding openly, swapping childcare), whispering hierarchies
