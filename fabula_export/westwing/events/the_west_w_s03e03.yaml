  title: Rollins Stonewalls Voracious Press with Cryptic Smirk
  description: A black sedan delivers Special Prosecutor Clem Rollins to the Federal
    District Court amid a chaotic swarm of shouting reporters. As he emerges, they
    aggressively demand details on subpoenas targeting President Bartlet and his inner
    circle—when they'll be issued, if at all. Rollins maintains ironclad control,
    responding only with curt 'No, I can't' denials, his knowing smile on the second
    betraying strategic confidence and unflappable resolve. This gauntlet amplifies
    the investigation's mounting pressure, positioning Rollins as a formidable adversary
    while teasing withheld revelations.

  title: 'Babish Corners Rollins: Leaks, Waivers, and Impaneled Subpoenas'
  description: In the courthouse lobby, Oliver Babish ambushes Special Prosecutor
    Clem Rollins, insisting on the White House's good-faith cooperation while slamming
    leaks to the Wall Street Journal. Trailing Rollins to a private room, Babish offers
    voluntary documents and floats waiving executive privilege to avert subpoenas,
    but Rollins stonewalls, demanding commitments on attorney-client, spousal, and
    doctor-patient privileges before curtly dismissing him with 'no extra credit.'
    Undaunted, Rollins addresses the grand jury, reading subpoenas for President Bartlet,
    his family, and top staff—formalizing the probe's escalation and rebuffing backchannel
    diplomacy, fueling White House retaliation.

  title: Josh's Desperate Plea for Donna Derailed by Yellowstone Fire
  description: In a frantic hallway catch-up extending into Josh's bullpen, Josh urgently
    confides in Sam that Donna is 'two, three days from unspooling' and begs for senior
    Communications assistants to help. Sam pivots to the Yellowstone wildfire—a dry
    lightning strike in a lodgepole pine forest now at 500 acres within a 'resource
    benefit zone'—detailing the 'let it burn' policy to allow natural forest regeneration.
    He stresses President Bartlet must call Wyoming Governor Bill Horton solely for
    optics to preempt backlash. Fleeting banter about childhood dreams (Sam as firefighter,
    Josh as ballerina) injects levity, revealing frayed personal bonds and the mounting
    toll of crises on staff loyalty and bandwidth.

  title: Doug Reveals Estate Tax Compromise Details
  description: In the Roosevelt Room, amid the White House's escalating battles, politically
    astute staffer Connie directly probes Doug on the estate tax negotiations. Doug
    discloses the current $1M exemption threshold, explaining Republicans demanded
    a $5M hike but settled for $2.5M after hard-fought concessions. With Toby Ziegler
    present, this revelation crystallizes the administration's fragile fiscal compromises,
    exposing Republican priorities and sharpening the partisan stakes in resisting
    full repeal during a moment of profound vulnerability.

  title: C.J. Parries Privilege Probe, Strikes at Rollins' Writings
  description: In a tense briefing room clash, Bobbi accuses President Bartlet of
    self-protective ambiguity despite waiving Executive Privilege. C.J. staunchly
    defends national security imperatives, quips defiantly against 'coyness,' then
    pivots aggressively, urging reporters to scrutinize Special Prosecutor Rollins'
    academic writings on privilege from his UChicago professorship and Yale Law Review
    editorship. This calculated redirection undermines Rollins' impartiality, fortifying
    White House messaging as a proactive turning point in the partisan legal war,
    revealing C.J.'s resilient command amid grief and subpoenas.

    the right to withhold certain documents? Isn''t he just trying to protect himself?"'

    pertaining to national security, for instance."'
  - 'BOBBI: "Stop being coy, C.J.." C.J.: "I was born this way."'

  title: 'Estate Tax Override: Black Caucus Fracture Revealed'
  description: In a tense late-night briefing, Josh and Toby inform Leo that Republicans
    have locked 290 votes to override the estate tax repeal veto, with the California
    delegation demanding compromise and unexpected defections from the Black Caucus
    providing the final seven votes. Leo pinpoints the subtext—first-generation Black
    millionaires facing the tax—and directs them to meet Congressman Mark Richardson
    at once, crystallizing coalition fractures, escalating legislative peril, and
    forcing tactical realignment as a pivotal vulnerability exposure and setup for
    urgent ally wooing.

  title: Bartlet's Quiet Grief at Landingham's Desk Amid Fire Political Fallout
  description: Alone after Charlie's exit, President Bartlet tenderly caresses Mrs.

    ecological merits backed by experts. Bartlet vulnerably prays the experts are
    right; Leo offers to handle the imminent call, leaving Bartlet to pocket one of

    Josh Lyman's reductive assumptions about Black Caucus unity and urban-centric
    priorities, passionately defending estate tax repeal as vital for African-American

    Buckland's GOP poaching of allies like Campos—while pleading for unwavering veto
    support on core urban issues. Richardson refuses to commit the fractious Caucus,
    mirroring broader defections, leaving Josh and Toby in stunned silence as the
    veto's isolation deepens, marking a pivotal fracture in Democratic solidarity.

    prosecutor's impartial probe, honing her instincts as internal tensions simmer
    before the full staff witnesses Thomas's announcement.

  title: Defiant Staff Watches Thomas Ignite Oversight Hearings
  description: In the bustling Communications Office, Oliver sharply confronts C.J.
    for sabotaging the independent probe by manipulating the press and using Ainsley.
    Donna, piecing together the partisan trap, deflates upon learning Thomas's House
    Oversight Committee has seized jurisdiction. The staff unites, transfixed by C-SPAN
    as rabid Congressman Randall Thomas gavels in immediate hearings, accusing the
    White House of abusing power to defraud the public. C.J.'s whispered 'Come and
    get us' crystallizes their provoked resolve, escalating the crisis into open political
    warfare—a pivotal payoff to her aggressive strategy amid unraveling grief and
    pressure.

  summary: 'The episode ignites with a dramatic and public display of legal authority
    as Special Prosecutor Clement Rollins, a figure of unflappable resolve, emerges
    from the federal courthouse. Surrounded by a clamoring press corps, he maintains
    a stone-faced silence regarding the impending subpoenas, amplifying the tension.
    Inside, Oliver Babish, the White House counsel, intercepts Rollins in a tense
    hallway ambush, immediately challenging the integrity of Rollins''s office, accusing
    it of egregious leaks to the Wall Street Journal. Babish vehemently asserts the
    White House''s unwavering commitment to good faith and full cooperation, even
    hinting at President Bartlet''s willingness to waive executive privilege. Rollins,
    however, remains impervious to Babish''s pleas, subtly probing the limits of the
    White House''s cooperation by questioning the waiver of attorney-client and spousal
    privileges. The confrontation culminates in a chilling moment as Rollins enters
    a grand jury room, where, with a clear throat and an air of solemn duty, he formally
    reads an exhaustive list of subpoenaed individuals. The names cascade like a series
    of thunderbolts: President Josiah Bartlet, his wife Abbey, their daughters Elizabeth,
    Eleanor, and Zoey, alongside his most trusted advisors—Leo McGarry, Josh Lyman,
    C.J. Cregg, Sam Seaborn, and Toby Ziegler. This declaration marks the official
    commencement of a sweeping federal investigation, plunging the entire Bartlet
    administration into an unprecedented legal and political battle, setting a relentless,
    urgent tone for the narrative ahead.'

  - Clement Rollins, surrounded by press, refuses to comment on impending subpoenas.
  - Oliver Babish confronts Rollins, accusing his office of leaks to the Wall Street
    Journal.

  summary: 'The White House reels under the weight of the subpoenas, confronting immediate

    Josh Lyman, attempting to escape Donna''s unraveling, grapples with a seemingly
    minor Yellowstone fire that Interior decides to let burn, highlighting the administration''s
    struggle with public perception versus expert ecological policy. Meanwhile, C.J.
    Cregg, rejecting Oliver Babish''s cautious, defensive spin, aggressively advocates
    for a proactive, offensive strategy: provoking partisan House hearings to discredit
    the Special Prosecutor. She identifies Oversight''s rabid inquisitor, Randall
    Thomas, as their ideal antagonist, a plan Leo McGarry shrewdly approves, grinning
    at the audacity. Concurrently, Toby Ziegler rages against Republican efforts to
    repeal the estate tax, cleverly dubbed the ''death tax,'' as compromise talks
    collapse, revealing the opposition''s intent to exploit the White House''s perceived
    weakness. The act concludes with C.J.''s initial press briefing, where she confidently

  summary: 'Tuesday dawns with escalating political maneuvers and the emergence of

    defection: Victor Campos, a powerful California union boss and crucial Bartlet
    ally, was seen courtside with Republican shark Jack Buckland and subsequently
    declined a key White House Community Empowerment board appointment. This betrayal
    sends Sam Seaborn on a high-stakes mission to re-secure Campos''s loyalty, with
    Bruno insisting on having a campaign spy present to ensure fidelity. Simultaneously,
    Ainsley Hayes, unaware of the broader political machinations, attempts to set

    House Ways and Means Committee—Josh''s direct adversary. This seemingly innocuous
    social interaction is fraught with underlying political tension, hinting at future
    complications. C.J. skillfully uses a press briefing to subtly leak the long-standing
    friendship between Rollins and Babish, aiming to sow seeds of doubt about the

  summary: 'Wednesday brings a calculated shift in the White House''s strategy and
    a poignant personal struggle for the President. Hill Democrats, concerned about
    the press''s ''soft'' treatment of Rollins, subtly nudge C.J. to downplay his
    integrity and his connection to Babish. C.J. seizes this opportunity, tasking
    Ainsley with an off-record leak to conservative press, questioning how the President
    can waive executive privilege yet still withhold documents, thereby strategically
    undermining Rollins''s perceived fairness. Meanwhile, President Bartlet grapples
    with a deeper, more personal void: his inability to find a suitable replacement
    for Mrs. Landingham, his late secretary. His obsessive search for the ''perfect
    pen'' and Charlie Young''s gentle reminder that Mrs. Landingham used to slip them
    into his pocket reveals the profound grief and emotional paralysis still affecting
    him, impacting his ability to fully engage with the mounting political crises.
    Sam Seaborn, preparing for his crucial meeting with Victor Campos, learns from
    Connie that Campos is a California kingmaker, controlling a vast voter mobilization
    machine, underscoring the high stakes of their negotiation. Donna''s date with
    Cliff Calley at the Farragut Grill, initially a clash of ideologies, ends with
    a promise of a second date, but a subtle undercurrent of political maneuvering
    hints at future complications. C.J. deftly deflects press inquiries about Rollins,
    redirecting them to his academic writings, further muddying the waters. The act
    concludes with Josh and Toby confirming the Republicans have enough votes for
    an estate tax repeal, with Leo revealing the unexpected defection of Black Caucus
    members, leaving Bartlet in quiet contemplation, finding solace in Mrs. Landingham''s
    pens, a symbol of his lingering grief amidst the political storm.'

  - President Bartlet's search for a pen and Charlie's revelation highlight his ongoing

  summary: Thursday brings the dramatic culmination of several converging storylines,
    pushing the White House to its breaking point. Donna's second date with Cliff
    Calley takes a sharp, revealing turn when he discloses his 'trade' to House Government
    Oversight—the very committee C.J. strategically intended to provoke. This revelation
    confirms the White House's trap has been sprung, but at a personal cost to Donna,
    who realizes she was a pawn in a larger game. Simultaneously, Sam Seaborn confronts
    Victor Campos in a heated, loyalty-testing exchange, ultimately securing Campos's
    crucial California delegates for the Democrats by offering a bold amnesty deal,
    guided by Connie's astute political calculus. In the Roosevelt Room, Toby Ziegler
    and Josh Lyman desperately try to sway Congressman Mark Richardson and the Black
    Caucus, emphasizing the administration's 'bleeding' vulnerability, but Richardson,
    acutely aware of the White House's weakened state, refuses to guarantee their
    votes. The Yellowstone fire, now consuming 6500 acres, becomes a symbol of Bartlet's
    defiance, as he gambles on an Alberta cold front and asserts his firm resolve
    to veto the estate tax repeal, despite the immense political risk and governors'
    'pyromaniac' jeers. The act climaxes in the Communications Office bullpen, where
    the staff, united and defiant, watches Congressman Randall Thomas gavel the House
    Oversight hearings into session on C-SPAN. C.J., taking a defiant sip of beer,
    whispers, 'Come and get us,' as the White House steels itself for the public battle
    ahead, vulnerable yet unbreakable.
  key_moments:
  - Cliff Calley reveals to Donna his 'trade' to House Government Oversight, confirming
    C.J.'s strategic maneuver to provoke hearings.
  - Sam Seaborn, with Connie's guidance, secures Victor Campos's loyalty and California
    delegates by offering a bold amnesty deal.
  - Toby and Josh fail to secure the Black Caucus's support for the estate tax, highlighting
    the administration's political isolation.
  - President Bartlet, despite the escalating Yellowstone fire and political pressure,
    firmly resolves to veto the estate tax repeal, betting on a weather report.
  - Congressman Randall Thomas gavels the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee
    hearings into session, and C.J. defiantly whispers, 'Come and get us,' as the
    White House staff prepares for the fight.
