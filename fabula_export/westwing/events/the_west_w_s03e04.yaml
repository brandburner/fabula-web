  title: Kovaleski Delivers Death Tax Override Bill to Nervous Rookie Dolan
  description: In the dimly lit Executive Clerk's office late at night, the stoic
    Kovaleski, accompanied by a uniformed guard, enters and hands rookie clerk Donald
    Dolan—a nervous second-week employee working alone—the blue file containing the
    House-passed 'Death Tax Elimination Act' override bill. Dolan, visibly anxious
    yet protocol-savvy, confirms instructions to notify Deputy Chief of Staff Josh
    Lyman immediately for President Bartlet's signature or veto. He dials Josh right
    as Kovaleski exits, igniting the White House's frantic crisis response and underscoring
    the procedural gravity thrusting the override battle into high gear as a pivotal
    setup for the episode's political frenzy.

  title: C.J.'s Sarcastic Veto Announcement Ignites Press Frenzy
  description: In the packed Briefing Room, C.J. launches a biting, sarcastic announcement
    of President Bartlet's veto of HR10—the 'Death Tax' bill—mocking Republican fearmongering

  title: Sam Alerts Toby to Surprise Vote, Sparking Whip Count Frenzy
  description: In Sam's office, Sam urgently hangs up from the Minority Leader's office
    to alert Toby of a surprise House vote on the veto override in just 90 minutes.
    Toby's biting sarcasm excavates the political miscalculation—Bartlet's unpopularity
    dooming Democrats against a tax cut—before mobilizing Ginger for phone lines and
    legislative staff in the Roosevelt Room. Sam pushes for a fresh whip count, frustrated
    by the time crunch, and orders Bonnie to ground departing Democratic members by
    paging airlines, transforming shock into a high-stakes defensive scramble that
    escalates the veto battle's urgency.

  title: Whip Count Frenzy Confirms Kimball Defection
  description: In the Roosevelt Room, Sam, Toby, Ed, and Larry launch a frantic whip
    count as the House schedules debate in 90 minutes followed by a veto override
    vote. Toby mobilizes aides and summons Leo while Sam briefly pulls Charlie aside
    for a hushed warning on immunity pressure before coordinating with Donna. Suspicion
    mounts over missing votes, pinpointed to Kimball's defection when Toby confirms
    him on the line. Leo seizes control, commanding Kimball's immediate White House
    appearance. This turning point crystallizes the vote's peril, demanding decisive
    intervention amid layered crises.

  title: Sam Pulls Charlie Aside to Warn of Immunity Proffer
  description: Amid the Roosevelt Room's whip count frenzy, Sam steps into the hallway
    to urgently pull Charlie aside, warning him that the House committee will offer
    a proffer for immunity to fracture his loyalty to President Bartlet. Charlie,
    stoic and principled, acknowledges the implication—'I get immunity'—but shuts
    down the conversation, insisting he's not allowed to discuss it. This tense exchange
    excavates the personal stakes of the political maelstrom, testing Charlie's unwavering
    allegiance and foreshadowing his integrity as a crossroads amid the estate tax
    override crisis.

  title: Sam Pulls Charlie Aside to Warn of Immunity Proffer
  description: Amid the Roosevelt Room's whip count frenzy, Sam steps into the hallway
    to urgently pull Charlie aside, warning him that the House committee will offer
    a proffer for immunity to fracture his loyalty to President Bartlet. Charlie,
    stoic and principled, acknowledges the implication—'I get immunity'—but shuts
    down the conversation, insisting he's not allowed to discuss it. This tense exchange
    excavates the personal stakes of the political maelstrom, testing Charlie's unwavering
    allegiance and foreshadowing his integrity as a crossroads amid the estate tax
    override crisis.

  title: Leo Briefs C.J. on Levy Brothers Bombing and Comms Strategy
  description: Leo pulls C.J. into his office for a terse strategy session on the
    Jerusalem suicide bombing, now breaking news. He reveals the victims were American
    brothers from the Levy family, killed at a soccer match, but instructs her to
    withhold names and targeting speculation to protect security. C.J. offers to absorb
    press heat so the grieving Levys learn from the President directly, who will call
    them. She can confirm Bartlet's outreach to Israel's PM but must dampen expectations
    of restraint amid Erev Yom Kippur tensions. This efficient beat equips C.J. for
    her briefing, excavating the conflict between empathy and geopolitical pragmatism
    while escalating the crisis arc.

  title: C.J. Presses Charlie's Steadfast Immunity Refusal
  description: Emerging from Leo's office into the outer hallway, C.J. intercepts
    Charlie, urgently confronting his refusal to accept an immunity deal amid the
    share-trading scandal probe. She pushes hypothetically, framing it as a 'get out
    of jail free' card that spares him endless legal hours, intuiting his loyalty
    to President Bartlet as the barrier. Charlie stonewalls with curt deflections,
    insisting no one's going to jail and dodging discussion. The exchange peaks in
    tense subtext-laden silence, broken by Charlie's awkward, unflinching joke offer
    to 'watch' her change clothes—quickly whispered 'No'—revealing his protective
    allegiance while personalizing the White House's mounting legal peril amid dual
    crises.

  title: Toby Corners Defector Kimball on Grazing Fees Ultimatum
  description: Outside the White House, Toby intercepts late-arriving Congressman
    Kimball, sharply rebuking his delay and sudden betrayal on the veto override vote.
    Kimball smugly reveals his four proxies, granting him leverage to demand concessions
    on grazing fees, dismissing estate tax rhetoric. Toby invokes the Democratic Party's
    historical support for Tennessee farmers via TVA and safety nets, decrying the
    defection from a Democratic president. Outmaneuvered and time-starved, Toby grudgingly
    pivots to negotiation, exemplifying the frantic, principle-testing horse-trading
    essential to salvaging Bartlet's veto amid mounting crisis.

  title: Leo Briefed on Armed Israeli Jets and Mujeeb Link
  description: 'In the tense Situation Room, Leo interrogates Nancy and an Advisor
    for intel: 12 armed F-15s primed at Hatzerim with pilots aboard and heat plumes,
    plus airborne Apaches carrying Hellfires. He dismisses Israel''s ''training exercise''
    cover, confirms likely targets in Hebron and Ramallah, and notes Egypt''s threat
    of an emergency Arab summit on retaliation. Pivoting to the bomber''s C-4, Nancy
    reveals ties to Abdul Mujeeb—Leo''s ''way out''—prompting him to urgently summon
    the President. This revelation heightens Erev Yom Kippur stakes, blending imminent
    escalation with a slim diplomatic off-ramp, propelling the crisis arc forward.'

  title: Leo Briefed on Armed Israeli Jets and Mujeeb Link
  description: 'In the tense Situation Room, Leo interrogates Nancy and an Advisor
    for intel: 12 armed F-15s primed at Hatzerim with pilots aboard and heat plumes,
    plus airborne Apaches carrying Hellfires. He dismisses Israel''s ''training exercise''
    cover, confirms likely targets in Hebron and Ramallah, and notes Egypt''s threat
    of an emergency Arab summit on retaliation. Pivoting to the bomber''s C-4, Nancy
    reveals ties to Abdul Mujeeb—Leo''s ''way out''—prompting him to urgently summon
    the President. This revelation heightens Erev Yom Kippur stakes, blending imminent
    escalation with a slim diplomatic off-ramp, propelling the crisis arc forward.'

  title: Leo Briefed on Armed Israeli Jets and Mujeeb Link
  description: 'In the tense Situation Room, Leo interrogates Nancy and an Advisor
    for intel: 12 armed F-15s primed at Hatzerim with pilots aboard and heat plumes,
    plus airborne Apaches carrying Hellfires. He dismisses Israel''s ''training exercise''
    cover, confirms likely targets in Hebron and Ramallah, and notes Egypt''s threat
    of an emergency Arab summit on retaliation. Pivoting to the bomber''s C-4, Nancy
    reveals ties to Abdul Mujeeb—Leo''s ''way out''—prompting him to urgently summon
    the President. This revelation heightens Erev Yom Kippur stakes, blending imminent
    escalation with a slim diplomatic off-ramp, propelling the crisis arc forward.'

  title: Leo Briefed on Armed Israeli Jets and Mujeeb Link
  description: 'In the tense Situation Room, Leo interrogates Nancy and an Advisor
    for intel: 12 armed F-15s primed at Hatzerim with pilots aboard and heat plumes,
    plus airborne Apaches carrying Hellfires. He dismisses Israel''s ''training exercise''
    cover, confirms likely targets in Hebron and Ramallah, and notes Egypt''s threat
    of an emergency Arab summit on retaliation. Pivoting to the bomber''s C-4, Nancy
    reveals ties to Abdul Mujeeb—Leo''s ''way out''—prompting him to urgently summon

    to avert escalation on Erev Yom Kippur, urgently demands Sally fetch the President,
    transforming imminent crisis into actionable hope and marking a pivotal narrative

  title: Leo Mandates Hardline Ultimatum and Aggressive Leak
  description: 'In Leo''s outer office, Toby''s brief, futile probe of Charlie on
    immunity fails before the team enters Leo''s office. Sam and Toby detail mounting
    concessions to defector Kimball—grazing fees, farm contracts, milk antibiotics—prompting
    Leo''s shock. Josh seeks to placate Buckland; Leo refuses, ordering a brutal leak
    framing Buckland as blackmailing the President on environmental and worker issues,
    invoking Red Auerbach''s ''throw an elbow'' analogy to embrace known aggression.
    Toby gets an ultimatum for Kimball: take it or leave it. Exiting, Sam urgently
    pitches offering the same to Republicans like Royce for bipartisan votes, transforming
    Leo''s confrontation into strategic leverage. This turning point reasserts Leo''s
    iron authority, shifts from appeasement to resolve, and seeds a pivotal vote-flipping
    gambit amid the override crisis.'

    Kimball and his band of four, then Buckland? Let him know we''re going to put
    it out he tried to Blackmail the President unless he caved to industry on clean
    air, clean water climate control, and worker safety. Emphasize worker safety.
    That''ll get him in good with the unions.'

    on the table in there... take it or leave it.'

  title: Sam Pitches Bipartisan Flip to Republicans
  description: As Toby exits Leo's office post-hardline directive, Sam urgently pulls
    him aside, proposing they extend the same concessions—grazing fee moratoriums,
    farm subsidies, and FDA crackdowns—already tabled for Democrats to farm-state
    Republicans like Royce. Royce could deliver six GOP votes for seven total, flipping
    Kimball's defectors upon glimpsing victory, enabling C.J. to tout bipartisanship
    while amplifying Leo's aggressive 'elbow' on national TV. This tactical pivot
    transforms potential defeat into a decisive, image-boosting win, revealing Sam's
    strategic foresight amid escalating override pressure.

  title: Charlie Defiantly Rejects Leo's Immunity Offer
  description: In Leo's office, a fatherly yet firm Leo urgently presses Charlie to
    accept an immunity deal from a partisan prosecution, warning of bankruptcy and
    ruined law school prospects to shield his young aide from peril. Charlie, eyes
    flashing with resolve, counters that immunity implies guilt and betrays his team's
    trust, vowing to stay loyal despite the risks. Stunned by Charlie's heroism, Leo
    relents just as Margaret interrupts. This tense standoff crystallizes Charlie's
    unwavering integrity, heightening the staff's collective vulnerability amid the
    investigation—a character-defining turning point that costs Charlie personally
    while deepening themes of loyalty and sacrifice.

  title: Phil Presses C.J. on President's Mujeeb Handover Demand
  description: In the chaotic White House press room at night, reporters clamor for
    C.J.'s attention during her briefing, with Carol at her side. Phil cuts through
    the noise, directly challenging if President Bartlet urged the Chairman to hand
    over Abdul Mujeeb, the bomber linked to the Jerusalem attack killing American
    brothers. C.J. masterfully deflects with rehearsed diplomacy, reiterating the
    call for ceasefire adherence and U.S. peace process commitment. This pivotal press
    skirmish heightens crisis tension, showcasing C.J.'s command under scrutiny while
    shielding aggressive administration moves, advancing the theme of restrained power
    amid escalation.

  description: In the bustling hallway outside the press room, Carol scurries up behind
    the briskly walking C.J., urgently alerting her to a high-stakes meeting in the
    Oval Office. C.J. acknowledges with a clipped 'Thanks,' instantly pivoting from

    masterfully conveys the White House's frenetic rhythm, yanking C.J. from public-facing
    duties into the epicenter of executive decision-making amid the estate tax override
    and Jerusalem bombing crises, heightening anticipation for pivotal plot escalation.

  title: Staff Wrestles Levy Condolence as Bartlet Reveals Erev Yom Kippur's Human
    Forgiveness
  description: 'In the weary predawn Oval Office, an exhausted senior staff—Bartlet,
    Leo, Toby, Sam, Josh, and C.J.—debates phrasing a condolence for the slain Levy
    brothers, grappling with whether their deaths advance the peace process or were
    futile amid escalating violence. Josh bluntly rejects silver linings, while Toby
    and others propose idealistic ''spirit of peace'' language. Bartlet, pensive,
    pivots to a profound Erev Yom Kippur insight: humans must seek forgiveness from
    each other before God, intertwining personal atonement with diplomatic reckoning.
    Dismissing all for a solitary call to the Levys, he confesses paternal inadequacy,
    marking a turning point of raw vulnerability before the episode''s close.'

  summary: 'The White House plunges into a dual crisis as the Teaser establishes the
    immediate threat: Kovaleski delivers the ''Death Tax Elimination Act'' to a nervous
    rookie clerk, Donald Dolan, deep in the White House night. Dolan''s call ignites
    a frantic scramble among senior staff—Josh, Donna, C.J., Toby, Sam, Bartlet, and
    Leo—who are all dressed for a Nobel gala. Their elegant evening shatters as Republicans
    abruptly cancel their attendance, a clear signal of their intent to force an immediate
    override vote on Bartlet''s impending veto. The staff debates the wisdom of vetoing
    the bill now versus waiting, with Sam advocating for delay and Toby pushing for
    immediate action. Bartlet, despite the mounting pressure and the strategic trap
    laid by the opposition, defiantly seizes the pen, stamps his veto with a flourish,
    and hurls the bill back, declaring, ''Send it back.'' This audacious move sets
    the stage for a political showdown. Immediately, the narrative pivots to C.J.
    masterfully deflecting aggressive press questions about the veto, all while dodging
    whispers of the override. In the Roosevelt Room, phones blaze with whip counts
    as the staff discovers key votes have flipped, with three Democrats unaccounted
    for, likely on planes. Toby confronts Congressman Kimball, who has defected, revealing
    a ''shopping list'' of demands. Just as the political battle intensifies, a far
    more devastating reality intrudes: Nancy McNally storms into Leo''s office, delivering
    the horrific news of a suicide bombing in Jerusalem. Ten lives are lost, including
    two American brothers, Ariel and Noah Levy, who appear to have been deliberately
    targeted. The White House, already on high alert for a domestic political fight,
    now faces a rapidly escalating international crisis with profound human cost,
    forcing an immediate shift in focus and priorities.'

  - Kovaleski delivers the 'Death Tax Elimination Act' to rookie clerk Dolan in the

  - Republicans abruptly cancel their attendance at the Nobel gala, signaling their

  - President Bartlet, defying caution and political maneuvering, defiantly vetoes
    the bill, declaring 'Send it back,' committing to the fight.
  - Sam and Toby discover the Republicans have scheduled an override vote in 90 minutes,
    sparking a frantic scramble for votes and a new whip count.
  - Nancy McNally delivers the devastating news of a suicide bombing in Jerusalem,
    confirming two American brothers, Ariel and Noah Levy, were among the targeted

  summary: The Situation Room pulses with urgent reality as Bartlet confronts the
    grim details of the Jerusalem bombing. Nancy McNally confirms traces of C-4, hinting
    at Afghan or Iranian connections, and chilling eyewitness accounts reveal the
    Levy brothers were targeted specifically for their U.S. sweatshirts. Bartlet,
    his face etched with gravity, demands 'temperature-cooling options,' recognizing
    the volatile geopolitical implications. Simultaneously, C.J. grapples with the
    emotional weight of the tragedy, then attempts to persuade Charlie to accept immunity
    in an ongoing investigation, but Charlie remains steadfastly loyal, refusing to
    compromise his integrity. The domestic political battle rages on as Josh engages
    Governor Jack Buckland in the Mural Room. Buckland, eyeing a primary challenge,
    subtly probes Bartlet's health, forcing Josh to defend the President's vigor while
    subtly dangling a Labor Secretary position. Meanwhile, Toby confronts Congressman
    Kimball outside, whose defection threatens the veto override. Kimball, unyielding,
    presents a 'shopping list' of demands—grazing fees and farm safety nets—exposing
    the transactional nature of the political game. C.J. returns to the press room,
    facing a barrage of questions about the bombing. She expertly deflects inquiries
    about American casualties, citing the 1974 Privacy Act, but Sherri Wexler's aggressive
    questioning hints at deeper tensions. On the Portico, Leo informs Bartlet that
    a Palestinian splinter group, the Palestine Freedom Front, is responsible for
    the bombing. Bartlet, his resolve hardening, demands Arafat's explicit denunciation
    of violence and immediate security cooperation with the Israelis, desperate to
    prevent a devastating retaliatory strike that could ignite the entire region.
    The dual pressures—domestic political survival and international de-escalation—intensify,
    pushing the White House staff to their limits.
  key_moments:
  - Bartlet enters the Situation Room, immediately confronting the devastating details
    of the Jerusalem bombing, including the C-4 traces and the deliberate targeting
    of the Levy brothers.
  - Josh engages Governor Buckland in a tense exchange, where Buckland probes Bartlet's
    health for a potential primary challenge, revealing the President's vulnerability.
  - Toby confronts Congressman Kimball, who explicitly outlines his 'shopping list'
    of demands—grazing fees and farm nets—in exchange for his crucial votes.
  - C.J. masterfully deflects aggressive press inquiries about the American casualties,
    citing privacy, but faces pointed challenges from Sherri Wexler.
  - Bartlet, on the Portico with Leo, demands Arafat's public denunciation of violence
    and immediate security cooperation to prevent Israeli retaliation, setting a critical
    diplomatic imperative.

  summary: 'The political maneuvering reaches a fever pitch as Sam and Toby continue
    to negotiate with Kimball, who stubbornly insists on a one-year moratorium on
    grazing fees and a litany of agricultural subsidies. Sam, with a flash of strategic
    brilliance, realizes Kimball''s demands are not unique but generic, leading him
    to suggest a bold pivot: offer the exact same deal to moderate Republican Congressman
    Royce, hoping to flip a larger bloc of votes and achieve a bipartisan victory.
    Meanwhile, Josh, armed with Buckland''s abysmal poll numbers, relentlessly attempts
    to dissuade the Indiana Governor from a primary challenge. He lays bare Buckland''s
    lack of funding and voter support, then subtly dangles the enticing prospect of
    a Labor Secretary position, a calculated move to neutralize a potential threat.
    The international crisis escalates dramatically as intelligence from the Situation
    Room reveals Israeli F-15s and Apache helicopters are armed and ready at Hatzerim
    Air Base, targeting Hebron and Ramallah, signaling imminent retaliation. Nancy
    McNally delivers a crucial breakthrough: the bomber has ties to Abdul Mujeeb,
    offering a potential diplomatic off-ramp to the escalating conflict. Leo, his
    patience worn thin by the political gamesmanship, issues a stern directive to
    Josh: ''take him out!'' He orders a strategic leak to discredit Buckland, emphasizing
    worker safety to appeal to unions, a clear signal that the White House will play
    hardball. Empowered by Leo''s ''take it or leave it'' mandate, Toby aggressively
    withdraws all previous concessions from Kimball, asserting the White House''s
    newfound strength. The act concludes with Bartlet visiting his sick wife, Abbey,
    in their bedroom. He shares the somber news of the Jerusalem bombing and expresses
    his deep concern for their daughter, Zoey, revealing a rare moment of personal
    vulnerability amidst the relentless pressures of his office.'
  key_moments:
  - Josh confronts Governor Buckland with his devastating poll numbers, attempting
    to dismantle his primary challenge while subtly offering the Labor Secretary position.
  - The Situation Room reveals Israeli F-15s and Apache helicopters armed and ready
    at Hatzerim Air Base, poised for retaliation, escalating the international crisis.
  - Nancy McNally identifies the Jerusalem bomber's ties to Abdul Mujeeb, providing
    a crucial lead for a diplomatic resolution.
  - Leo, frustrated by political posturing, orders Josh to aggressively discredit
    Governor Buckland, signaling a shift to hardball political tactics.
  - 'Sam proposes a strategic pivot: offer Kimball''s deal to moderate Republican
    Royce to secure a larger bloc of votes and achieve a bipartisan victory.'
  - Toby, empowered by Leo's directive, aggressively withdraws all concessions from
    Congressman Kimball, asserting the White House's firm negotiating stance.

  summary: 'Dawn approaches as Bartlet and Leo finalize their high-stakes diplomatic
    strategy on the Portico: they will threaten Arafat with a $100 million NGO aid
    cutoff unless Abdul Mujeeb is immediately handed over to the Israelis, a desperate
    gamble to ''put the pin back in the grenade'' for at least a day. In the Mural
    Room, Josh successfully concludes his negotiation with Governor Buckland, securing
    his withdrawal from the primary by explicitly offering him the Labor Secretary
    position, a political victory achieved through strategic leverage. The personal
    drama intensifies as Donna reveals her blind date with an Oversight lawyer, triggering
    a raw, emotionally charged confrontation with Josh. His hurt and betrayal bleed
    through his forced composure, culminating in a cold dismissal that fractures their
    unspoken dynamic. C.J., in a stunning display of power and control, publicly humiliates
    Sherri Wexler in the press room, exposing her journalistic incompetence, then
    strips her of her press credentials, declaring ''Hunting season on me is over.''
    This decisive action reasserts C.J.''s authority and ends the personal attacks.
    A crucial breakthrough arrives: Palestinian police arrest Abdul Mujeeb in Gaza,
    bringing a temporary, fragile de-escalation to the international crisis. In the
    Oval Office, as the staff gathers to draft a eulogy for the Levy brothers, Bartlet
    pauses. He reflects on Erev Yom Kippur, the day before atonement, emphasizing
    the profound human need for forgiveness from others before seeking divine absolution.
    As his staff files out, leaving him alone, Bartlet picks up the receiver to call
    the grieving Levy parents. His voice heavy with sorrow and the weight of his office,
    he sighs, ''I have three children. I really don''t know what to say.'' The veto
    sustains, the international crisis cools, and personal reckonings unfold, leaving
    a fragile sense of resolve on the day before atonement.'
  key_moments:
  - Bartlet and Leo finalize their high-stakes plan to threaten Arafat with a $100
    million aid cutoff to secure Abdul Mujeeb's handover, aiming for temporary de-escalation.
  - Josh successfully secures Governor Buckland's withdrawal from the primary by offering
    him the Labor Secretary position, a calculated political maneuver.
  - Donna confesses her blind date with an Oversight lawyer, triggering a raw, emotionally
    charged confrontation with Josh that exposes their unspoken dynamic and his deep
    hurt.
  - C.J. publicly humiliates Sherri Wexler in the press room, then strips her of her
    press credentials, asserting control and declaring 'Hunting season on me is over.'
  - Palestinian police arrest Abdul Mujeeb in Gaza, providing a crucial, albeit temporary,
    de-escalation of the international crisis.
  - Bartlet, alone in the Oval Office on Erev Yom Kippur, makes the agonizing call
    to the grieving Levy parents, grappling with the profound inadequacy of words
    in the face of such loss.
