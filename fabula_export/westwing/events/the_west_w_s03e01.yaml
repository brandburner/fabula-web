  title: C.J.'s Special Prosecutor Bombshell Ignites Press Frenzy
  description: Under blinding lights, C.J. announces the President's order for a Special
    Prosecutor to probe the MS cover-up, triggering a chaotic barrage of reporter
    questions on procedures, witnesses, subpoenas, and congressional hearings. She
    parries with precision—revealing Republican-appointed judges and prosecutors,
    admitting likely staff subpoenas including her own—before signaling Carol and
    introducing Bartlet. Whispering a tactical tip ('Front row, on your right'), she
    yields the podium as he ascends amid flashing cameras, setting the stage for his
    defiant re-election pivot in this turning-point bid to seize narrative control
    amid scandal.

  title: Abbey's Icy Betrayal Rebuke and Bartlet's Defiant Deflection
  description: Fresh from his televised re-election pledge, Bartlet enters the Residence
    to face Abbey's wine-fueled fury. She lacerates him for publicly 'screwing' her
    without consultation, proposing a graceful exit via Dolores Landingham's funeral
    and family consultations. Bartlet rejects humor, reaffirms his run, then abruptly
    pivots to a Haiti evacuation briefing, evading reconciliation. Their exchange
    culminates in Abbey's sarcastic refusal to wait up, crystallizing marital fracture
    as a costly personal toll of his political defiance.

  description: 'In the tense Situation Room, Nancy briefs President Bartlet—entering
    with Leo—and assembled officers on Operation Swift Fury: a daring LHA-launched
    helicopter assault to evacuate Americans and Dessaline from the Haitian embassy

    enforcement and SIGINT confirming a clear radius, before authorizing the mission
    on a two-hour timeline. His understated approval elicits applause upon exit, crystallizing

  description: 'In a flashback to the White House Mess four weeks earlier, Toby demands
    a fresh poll post-MS disclosure, igniting debate among Josh, Sam, C.J., Ed, and
    Larry on the prior Michigan poll''s flaws: unrepresentative sample, governor-vs-president
    dynamics, Bartlet''s trustworthiness shield, and MS''s non-fatal nature. Consensus
    builds. Soaked Joey and Kenny burst in from the rain—abandoned by the motorcade
    in comic relief courtesy of Josh—passionately echoing the urgency, claiming Bartlet
    shone on TV. Josh seals unity: ''Put a poll in the field.'' This turning point
    resolves internal skepticism, injecting cautious optimism into the re-election

  title: Toby Forces Consensus on Urgent New Poll as Drenched Pollsters Reinforce
    Plea
  description: 'In a flashback to the White House Mess four weeks earlier, Toby demands
    a fresh poll post-MS disclosure, igniting debate among Josh, Sam, C.J., Ed, and
    Larry on the prior Michigan poll''s flaws: unrepresentative sample, governor-vs-president
    dynamics, Bartlet''s trustworthiness shield, and MS''s non-fatal nature. Consensus
    builds. Soaked Joey and Kenny burst in from the rain—abandoned by the motorcade
    in comic relief courtesy of Josh—passionately echoing the urgency, claiming Bartlet
    shone on TV. Josh seals unity: ''Put a poll in the field.'' This turning point
    resolves internal skepticism, injecting cautious optimism into the re-election
    strategy amid cover-up fallout.'

  title: Toby's Poll Update Meets Leo's Marital Deflection
  description: In a brisk exchange in Leo's office four weeks earlier, Toby confirms
    Joey Lucas's new poll to counter the bogus prior results, signaling cautious optimism
    amid re-election chaos. He locates the President in the residence and probes the
    First Lady's status, but Leo deflects with a pointed reminder of their overloaded
    agendas, rejecting marriage counseling roles. Toby exits with biting sarcasm,
    underscoring staff strains between professional duties and Bartlet family tensions.
    Margaret cues the next relentless meeting, propelling Leo forward as personal
    rifts simmer beneath campaign momentum. This beat heightens subtextual pressure
    on loyalty and endurance.

  title: Bartlet Orders Haiti Fly-By and Diplomatic Ultimatum
  description: 'In the Oval Office, President Bartlet convenes advisors to address
    Haiti''s coup, debating a risky F-18 fly-by against Bazan versus ineffective sanctions
    amid refugee warnings. He opts for a calibrated response: a message via Canada
    signaling intent to restore Dessaline, paired with a carrier fly-by, showcasing
    resolve without escalation. Josh and Toby later caution against re-election optics
    tying it to the MS scandal, but Bartlet dismisses political motivations, prioritizing
    moral urgency and prior U.S. attacks, underscoring his defiant leadership amid
    domestic pressures.'

  title: Bartlet Rebuffs Haiti as MS Distraction Warning
  description: As advisors exit the Oval Office post-Haiti strategy session, Josh
    and Toby urgently caution President Bartlet that any Haiti intervention risks
    being branded a politically motivated distraction from the MS scandal, especially
    amid re-election. Bartlet curtly rejects their optics-driven fears, stressing
    sanctions' futility, the Haitian police corruption, Dessaline's democratic legitimacy,
    the prior U.S. attack, and looming refugee crisis. He exits decisively, his moral
    resolve trumping political calculation in a pivotal character-defining clash that
    escalates campaign tensions.

  title: Josh and Toby's Exhausted Abbey Jabs and Haiti Messaging Pact
  description: After Bartlet storms out dismissing Haiti optics concerns, Josh and
    Toby linger alone in the Oval Office, their fatigue surfacing in dark humor about
    gauging the First Lady's seething fury over the re-election bid—Toby quipping
    'you first' when Josh suggests checking her 'temperature.' They pivot soberly
    as Toby instructs Josh to enforce restrained public posture on Haiti, avoiding
    anything that taints diplomatic options before considering invasion. Slumping
    silently against the desk, they embody the campaign team's fraying resilience
    amid MS scandal, Abbey's wrath, and mounting crises—a quiet turning point revealing
    personal toll beneath strategic grit.

  title: Charlie's Sharp Rebuke of Toby's Bartlet Marriage Probe
  description: In a tense New Hampshire bar amid campaign pressures, Charlie sinks
    the 8-ball to win the pool game, pocketing money as Toby offers insincere praise.
    Toby clumsily probes about the President and First Lady's marriage strife, but
    Charlie abruptly shuts him down, enforcing strict presidential protocol and personal
    boundaries to protect his role. Toby's awkward defense—likening it to a 'typical
    marriage'—is dismissed by Charlie's pointed reminder of the Bartlets' unique status.
    Left isolated, Toby sinks a lone shot, the fade-out crystallizing his outsider
    alienation and the team's fracturing dynamics.

    approval—a political landmine—pushing for delay or back-channel intervention,
    which Leo defers to the President. This beat offers brief relational respite before

  title: Josh-Donna Sandwich Squabble to RU-486 Alert
  description: In a dimly lit New Hampshire bar, Josh chides Donna for pilfering his
    food despite her earlier denial, their playful bickering revealing a deep, affectionate
    rapport that anchors the team amid re-election chaos. Bruno interrupts with sarcastic
    critiques of Leo's overly sentimental speech draft, joined by Connie and Doug,
    underscoring strategic tensions. Leo arrives irked by the lack of privacy, dismisses
    them curtly, but Josh pulls him aside to urgently reveal the FDA's imminent RU-486
    approval—a political landmine—pushing for delay or back-channel intervention,
    which Leo defers to the President. This beat offers brief relational respite before
    thrusting the narrative back into crisis, heightening campaign stakes.

    Josh urgently intercepts him near the door, revealing C.J.'s sourced intel on

  title: C.J.'s Exhausted Briefing Draws Press Fire on Marine Casualties
  description: Visibly drained from cascading crises including the MS cover-up and
    Haiti tensions, C.J. stands at the podium delivering sparse military details on
    five F-18 fighters and an E-2 Hawkeye involved in the operation. Toby watches
    tensely from the back as reporters erupt in shouts. C.J. fields Steve's aggressive
    probe on whether Bartlet has personally contacted injured Marines or their families,
    responding with a vague expression of presidential gratitude and concern. This
    defensive exchange exposes the administration's fraying facade, escalating media
    predation and foreshadowing C.J.'s impending press blunder amid re-election stakes.

    of re-election crises, MS fallout, and Abbey's fury on Bartlet's defiant seclusion,
    bridging Washington turmoil to personal confrontation.

  title: Bartlet Brushes Off Delays, Vows Defiant Re-Election Bid
  description: Leo warns Bartlet of the FDA's RU-486 approval, looming subpoenas,
    and Abbey/C.J. complications, urging a postponement masked as laryngitis to avoid
    a toxic news cycle. Irritable and resolute, Bartlet dismisses the risks with sarcasm—'We
    could just say I have MS'—and declares 'It's game time,' marching to the fence
    to affirm his unyielding intent to run and win. Leo silently concedes, their shared

  number: 1
  summary: 'Act One plunges into the immediate, high-stakes aftermath of President
    Bartlet''s defiant re-election announcement and his public disclosure of MS. The
    scene opens with Bartlet''s televised declaration, his jaw set, a challenging
    smile playing on his lips as he asserts, ''Yeah. And I''m going to win.'' This
    bold statement, however, immediately collides with the icy fury of his wife, Abbey,
    who drains her wine glass, her words lashing out like venom. She accuses him of
    burying Dolores Landingham''s memory by making such a monumental decision so soon
    after her funeral, urging him to find a way out, to claim medical consultation
    as an excuse. Bartlet, however, remains unyielding, his resolve hardening against
    her pleas, setting a tone of marital fracture that reverberates through the act.
    Simultaneously, the White House staff, particularly Josh, Donna, Toby, and Sam,
    ignite with a mix of adrenaline and chaos, scrambling to manage the political
    fallout. Toby, ever the pragmatist, immediately moves to cancel public appearances
    and mobilize media experts. Amidst this domestic and political maelstrom, Bartlet
    is whisked away to a tense Situation Room briefing, where military officers detail
    ''Operation Swift Fury,'' a daring helicopter evacuation of Americans and the
    leader Dessaline from Haiti under the threat of Cobra gunfire. This external crisis
    provides Bartlet with a tangible mission, a chance to project strength as Commander-in-Chief,
    yet it also highlights the immense pressure and the constant balancing act of
    his presidency. The act closes with the arrival of campaign strategist Bruno Gianelli,
    who clashes with Leo McGarry over the necessity of an apology for the MS cover-up.
    Bruno argues for an apology to boost flagging poll numbers, while Leo fiercely
    defends Bartlet''s refusal, framing the campaign announcement as a declaration
    of intent, not a confessional. This debate underscores the core tension: how does
    a President, having concealed a grave illness, navigate a re-election campaign
    while maintaining integrity and projecting strength? The act establishes the immediate
    challenges: a furious First Lady, a chaotic campaign launch, and an international
    crisis demanding presidential attention, all against the backdrop of an unyielding
    President.'
  key_moments:
  - President Bartlet defiantly declares his re-election bid on live television.
  - Abbey Bartlet confronts Jed, furious over his announcement and suggesting he withdraw
    from the race.
  - The White House staff, led by Josh and Toby, mobilizes in a chaotic scramble to
    manage the political fallout.
  - Bartlet receives a tense briefing on 'Operation Swift Fury,' a military evacuation
    in Haiti.
  - Bruno Gianelli and Leo McGarry clash over the President's refusal to apologize
    for the MS cover-up.

  summary: Act Two plunges back 'Four Weeks Earlier,' revealing the initial scramble
    and internal conflicts that preceded Bartlet's public announcement. The team grapples
    with 'bogus' early poll numbers, with Joey Lucas passionately arguing for a new,
    accurate survey, highlighting the critical need to understand public perception
    post-disclosure. Donna, in the present, receives confirmation of the FDA's impending
    approval of RU-486, a development she initially celebrates but quickly realizes
    will catastrophically derail the campaign's carefully orchestrated news cycle
    on Monday. Josh's frustration boils over, recognizing the political landmine this
    independent agency's timing represents. The act then shifts to a tense, high-stakes
    flashback in the Situation Room, where the 'Operation Swift Fury' in Haiti unfolds
    in real-time. Leo, Nancy, and the officers endure agonizing silence as helicopters
    evacuate personnel under fire, culminating in a Cobra being hit, injecting raw
    danger and sacrifice into the political drama. This sequence underscores the immense
    responsibility weighing on the President's team. Concurrently, Toby and Doug Wegland
    clash in a New Hampshire bar, their pool cues cracking like alliances, as Doug
    pushes for an apology in the re-election speech, only for Toby to dismiss it as
    a non-starter. A flashback to a press conference shows C.J. under immense pressure,
    visibly struggling as reporters relentlessly pivot from Haiti to the President's
    health, making her the story. Josh, observing C.J.'s faltering performance, contemplates
    leaking an 'incendiary' tobacco lawsuit release, a move Joey Lucas warns against
    as strategically stupid. The act concludes with Toby subtly challenging C.J. during
    a game of pool, hinting at his awareness of her impending, potentially career-ending,
    misstep, foreshadowing the dramatic climax to come.

  summary: Act Three continues to delve into the 'Four Weeks Earlier' period, exploring
    the moral and political complexities surrounding the Haiti crisis and the looming
    Special Prosecutor. President Bartlet, in the Oval Office, debates military options
    for Haiti with his advisors, weighing the efficacy of a 'display of force' against
    the risk of civilian casualties and a refugee crisis. He fiercely pushes back
    against Josh and Toby's suggestion that military intervention might be perceived
    as politically motivated, a cynical distraction from the MS scandal, asserting
    that the invasion is a matter of justice and democratic restoration, not political
    expediency. This internal struggle reveals Bartlet's deep-seated conviction and
    his refusal to be constrained by political optics when lives and principles are
    at stake. Simultaneously, Charlie Young is drawn into the chilling reality of
    the Special Prosecutor's investigation. Oliver Babish meticulously outlines the
    brutal, invasive nature of the inquiry, warning Charlie of the constant scrutiny,
    the risk of perjury, and the immense personal cost – a hundred thousand dollars
    for legal defense, even if innocent. This stark conversation shatters Charlie's
    naive confidence, exposing the vulnerability of even the most loyal staff members
    to the political machine. The act then shifts to a New Hampshire bar in the present,
    where Toby and Charlie play pool. Toby attempts to offer advice about the President
    and First Lady's marriage, but Charlie abruptly shuts him down, asserting that
    the President's marriage is far from 'typical' and that he cannot perform his
    duties if he's constantly shielded from sensitive information. This exchange highlights
    the strain on personal relationships within the White House and the unique burdens
    placed on those closest to power. The act underscores the profound personal and
    political costs associated with Bartlet's presidency, from the moral dilemmas
    of military action to the invasive threats of legal scrutiny and the erosion of
    personal boundaries.
  key_moments:
  - Bartlet debates military options for Haiti, rejecting the notion that it's politically
    motivated.
  - Oliver Babish warns Charlie Young about the invasive and costly nature of the
    Special Prosecutor's investigation.
  - Charlie's initial confidence about the investigation is shattered by Babish's
    stark warnings.
  - Toby attempts to discuss the President's marriage with Charlie, but Charlie rebuffs
    him, emphasizing the unique pressures.
  - The act highlights the personal and political costs of working in the White House,
    from legal threats to eroded privacy.

  summary: Act Four propels the narrative to its immediate, high-tension present,
    culminating in a catastrophic press blunder and a defiant presidential declaration.
    The campaign team, exhausted and frustrated in a New Hampshire bar, struggles
    with speech drafts, highlighting the internal disarray. Josh, confirming the RU-486
    approval for Monday, desperately tries to convince Leo to postpone Bartlet's speech,
    fearing the political fallout, but Leo, though concerned, defers to the President.
    A flashback to 'Four Weeks Earlier' reveals a glimmer of hope as Joey Lucas presents
    preliminary poll numbers showing Bartlet at 41% re-elect, putting him 'in the
    ball game' despite the MS disclosure. However, this fragile optimism is immediately
    undercut as Josh, against Sam's explicit advice, defiantly decides to leak an
    inflammatory press release targeting tobacco companies, demonstrating his willingness
    to play hardball even at the risk of alienating Congress. The act then explodes
    in a pivotal, disastrous press conference where C.J., visibly fatigued and under
    relentless questioning about the President's health and Haiti, makes a critical
    error. She snaps, stating Bartlet is 'relieved to be focusing on something that
    matters,' implying the MS scandal is trivial. The room falls silent, then erupts
    in a cacophony of questions, as C.J. realizes the profound magnitude of her blunder.
    Toby and Sam are left stunned, witnessing the self-inflicted wound. Leo's fury
    is barely contained as he confronts the team, lambasting C.J.'s 'misspeak' and
    the catastrophic implications for a potential Haiti invasion, fearing it will
    now appear politically motivated. The act culminates in Leo's tense confrontation
    with President Bartlet at his New Hampshire farm. Leo presents a litany of reasons
    to postpone the speech—RU-486, looming subpoenas, Abbey's arrival, C.J.'s gaffe—but
    Bartlet, smoking a cigarette amidst his grazing cows, dismisses every objection
    with a steely resolve. He defiantly declares, 'Screw it! It's game time. Let's
    go!' and with unwavering conviction, states, 'I'm running for reelection, and
    I'm gonna win.' The act closes with Bartlet and Leo gazing at the horizon, their
    shared silence heavy with the weight of the battle ahead, Bartlet's resolve hardening
    against the storm.
  key_moments:
  - Josh confirms RU-486 approval for Monday and urges Leo to postpone the speech.
  - A flashback reveals hopeful early poll numbers (41% re-elect) for Bartlet.
  - Josh leaks an 'incendiary' tobacco appropriations release against Sam's advice,
    demonstrating his aggressive strategy.
  - C.J. makes a catastrophic blunder in a press conference, stating Bartlet is 'relieved
    to be focusing on something that matters,' igniting a media firestorm.
  - Leo confronts Bartlet at his farm, but the President defiantly refuses to postpone
    his re-election announcement, asserting, 'I'm running for reelection, and I'm
    gonna win.'
