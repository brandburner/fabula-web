  title: Leo Vigorously Defends Josh's Deception Amid Bartlet's Ethical qualms
  description: As they walk from the portico into the Oval Office late at night, President
    Bartlet probes Leo about Josh's elaborate ruse to lure pollster Joey Lucas to
    D.C.—fabricating a polling trip on 'subsurface agriculture' (beets). Bartlet expresses
    discomfort with the deception, but Leo staunchly defends Josh's ingenuity as essential
    amid plummeting polls and crises, challenging Bartlet on trusting his top aide.
    To evade suspicion over their clandestine seven-person meeting, Leo urgently relocates
    them to the basement, underscoring the administration's heightened secrecy and
    pragmatic ruthlessness.

  title: 'Oval Office Briefing: Dessaline Vanishes in Haitian Coup Chaos'
  description: 'In a tense Oval Office gathering, Leo demands updates from Robbie,
    Jake, and a civilian advisor on Port-au-Prince, revealing 400+ trapped UN observers
    amid Bazan''s military moves: rally suppression killing two, Justice Minister
    Ducasse''s arrest, Chief Justice under house arrest, troops seizing police stations,
    and President-elect Dessaline''s unexplained disappearance. Bartlet probes sharply,
    dismisses Jake''s diplomatic cautions with raw resolve—citing recent Colombian
    deaths—and decisively orders non-essential embassy evacuations, Marine reinforcements,
    and Fitzwallace briefing, escalating the crisis as a pivotal turning point intensifying
    Bartlet''s burdens amid MS fallout and poll collapse.'

  title: 'Oval Office Briefing: Dessaline Vanishes in Haitian Coup Chaos'
  description: 'In a tense Oval Office gathering, Leo demands updates from Robbie,
    Jake, and a civilian advisor on Port-au-Prince, revealing 400+ trapped UN observers
    amid Bazan''s military moves: rally suppression killing two, Justice Minister
    Ducasse''s arrest, Chief Justice under house arrest, troops seizing police stations,
    and President-elect Dessaline''s unexplained disappearance. Bartlet probes sharply,
    dismisses Jake''s diplomatic cautions with raw resolve—citing recent Colombian
    deaths—and decisively orders non-essential embassy evacuations, Marine reinforcements,
    and Fitzwallace briefing, escalating the crisis as a pivotal turning point intensifying
    Bartlet''s burdens amid MS fallout and poll collapse.'

  title: Bartlet Overrides Jake, Orders Embassy Evacuation and Marines
  description: In the Oval Office briefing on the Haitian coup, after learning of
    Dessaline's disappearance and military encirclement, Leo proposes evacuating non-essential
    embassy personnel. Jake warns it signals U.S. doubt in the Dessaline government,
    risking diplomatic fallout. Bartlet decisively overrides, declaring no such government
    exists, invokes recent Colombian deaths for urgency, and commands evacuation of
    non-essentials, Marines to the embassy, and briefing Fitzwallace—escalating U.S.
    response, unifying the team under his authoritative resolve amid dual crises of
    MS fallout and international peril. This turning point setups intensified standoffs.

    government."'

  title: Bartlet Overrides Jake, Orders Embassy Evacuation and Marines
  description: In the Oval Office briefing on the Haitian coup, after learning of
    Dessaline's disappearance and military encirclement, Leo proposes evacuating non-essential
    embassy personnel. Jake warns it signals U.S. doubt in the Dessaline government,
    risking diplomatic fallout. Bartlet decisively overrides, declaring no such government
    exists, invokes recent Colombian deaths for urgency, and commands evacuation of
    non-essentials, Marines to the embassy, and briefing Fitzwallace—escalating U.S.
    response, unifying the team under his authoritative resolve amid dual crises of
    MS fallout and international peril. This turning point setups intensified standoffs.

  title: Bartlet Overrides Jake, Orders Embassy Evacuation and Marines
  description: In the Oval Office briefing on the Haitian coup, after learning of
    Dessaline's disappearance and military encirclement, Leo proposes evacuating non-essential
    embassy personnel. Jake warns it signals U.S. doubt in the Dessaline government,
    risking diplomatic fallout. Bartlet decisively overrides, declaring no such government
    exists, invokes recent Colombian deaths for urgency, and commands evacuation of
    non-essentials, Marines to the embassy, and briefing Fitzwallace—escalating U.S.
    response, unifying the team under his authoritative resolve amid dual crises of
    MS fallout and international peril. This turning point setups intensified standoffs.

  title: Josh's Coded Entry Ignites MS Disclosure Strategy Clash
  description: Josh utters the code word 'Saggitarius' to gain access past the guarding
    agent into the secure basement room, joining Toby, C.J., and pacing Sam in a high-stakes
    debate over revealing Bartlet's concealed MS. Sam advocates a raw, direct Presidential
    address from the Oval to humanize and apologize; C.J. counters for a warmer live
    30-minute Dateline special Wednesday night in the Mural Room with the First Lady,
    sans presidential seal, followed by a press conference to corral reporters and
    control the narrative. Toby mediates, locking in the plan amid reelection question
    fears. This turning point solidifies their damage-control blueprint, blending
    urgency with strategic precision amid embassy crisis and polling freefall.

  title: Josh's Coded Entry Ignites MS Disclosure Strategy Clash
  description: Josh utters the code word 'Saggitarius' to gain access past the guarding
    agent into the secure basement room, joining Toby, C.J., and pacing Sam in a high-stakes
    debate over revealing Bartlet's concealed MS. Sam advocates a raw, direct Presidential
    address from the Oval to humanize and apologize; C.J. counters for a warmer live
    30-minute Dateline special Wednesday night in the Mural Room with the First Lady,
    sans presidential seal, followed by a press conference to corral reporters and
    control the narrative. Toby mediates, locking in the plan amid reelection question
    fears. This turning point solidifies their damage-control blueprint, blending
    urgency with strategic precision amid embassy crisis and polling freefall.

  title: 'Staff Clashes Over MS Disclosure: Bold Address vs. Controlled Rollout'
  description: Josh enters the guarded basement after using the code 'Sagittarius'
    and joins Toby, C.J., and pacing Sam amid cratering polls. Sam demands a raw,
    10-15 minute Presidential address from the Oval to apologize and demystify the
    MS cover-up, but C.J. insists on a warmer live Wednesday Dateline special with
    the First Lady in the Mural Room, followed by a press conference to corral reporters.
    Toby refines the plan, Josh questions editing and timing, and Sam's reelection
    query exposes fractures—highlighting desperate narrative control amid reelection
    peril in this tense strategic turning point.

    and joins Toby, C.J., and pacing Sam amid cratering polls. Sam demands a raw,
    10-15 minute Presidential address from the Oval to apologize and demystify the
    MS cover-up, but C.J. insists on a warmer live Wednesday Dateline special with
    the First Lady in the Mural Room, followed by a press conference to corral reporters.
    Toby refines the plan, Josh questions editing and timing, and Sam's reelection
    query exposes fractures—highlighting desperate narrative control amid reelection
    peril in this tense strategic turning point.

  title: Bartlet Defies Risks, Orders Dessalines' Embassy Entry
  description: In the Oval Office, Leo urgently briefs President Bartlet on Dessalines'
    flight to the U.S. embassy after his bodyguards are shot, likely concealed in
    Jake Bratt's car trunk. Robbie warns of geopolitical peril—elevating Bazan via
    standoff and hostage risks—but Leo counters with moral imperatives of U.S.-backed
    elections. Bartlet overrides objections, ordering the gates opened; confirmation
    thrusts America into direct confrontation with the Haitian junta, a pivotal escalation
    underscoring his resolve amid MS scandal and reelection doom.

  title: 'Fiery Clash: Hoynes at the MS Press Conference?'
  description: In the White House basement, Toby floats including VP Hoynes at the
    MS revelation press conference to signal unity. Sam ardently pushes for it, framing
    Hoynes as endorsement of Bartlet's fitness and continuity. C.J. fires back sharply,
    fearing it spotlights the cover-up scandal and invites brutal press grilling on
    Hoynes' complicity. Sarcasm erupts as Sam's transparency zeal clashes with C.J.'s
    damage-control instincts. Haiti crisis note interrupts, sending C.J. to brief;
    Toby then gravely questions Sam on Bartlet's ability to function as president,
    unearthing raw succession fears amid plummeting polls.

  title: C.J. Abruptly Alerted to Haiti Crisis
  description: In the midst of tense debate preparations over including Hoynes in
    the MS press conference, a staffer interrupts with an urgent note for C.J. Toby
    hands her her glasses as she reads it, her face tightening. She announces a developing
    situation in Port-Au-Prince, excuses herself to prepare a briefing, and exits
    abruptly. This pivot from domestic political damage control to an international
    embassy crisis underscores the administration's spiraling multi-front chaos, pulling
    C.J. into high-stakes crisis management and amplifying stakes amid catastrophic
    polls.

  title: Josh Presses Ritter on Tobacco Funding Amid Haitian Absurdity
  description: Outside a D.C. building, Josh and Senator Ritter briefly marvel at
    the Haitian crisis's surreal escalation—the president-elect smuggled into the
    U.S. embassy in a car trunk—eliciting Ritter's weary resignation. Josh swiftly
    pivots to lobbying for a $30M Justice Department appropriations bill stalled in
    Ritter's committee to fund the landmark tobacco lawsuit. Ritter reveals the chairman's
    tobacco donor loyalty, a tight 8-7 against vote crossing party lines (including
    ideological holdouts Warren and Rossiter), underscoring congressional gridlock
    and moneyed interests thwarting the administration's justice agenda amid broader
    crises. Ritter's parting pat signals polite deflection, highlighting Josh's futile
    outreach in a multi-front political siege.

  title: C.J. Strong-Arms Hackett for Secret Unbranded Broadcast
  description: In the secretive Mural Room, evading the press corps via basement entry,
    C.J. confronts network head Paul Hackett with steely demands for a 30-minute live
    Wednesday slot—unbranded, featuring the President and First Lady in this very
    room, interviewer TBD. Stonewalling his Haiti probes as misdirection, she reveals
    nothing of the MS bombshell, framing it as her network's prestige play. Amid tense
    banter exposing her neck-deep crisis ('water exactly at my head'), she seals the
    deal with a no-leak ultimatum, securing a pivotal surprise platform that pivots
    the White House narrative from catastrophe to controlled revelation.

  description: 'In a tense conference room standoff amid White House crises, Josh
    confronts Congressmen Warren and Rossiter about their blockade of the tobacco
    lawsuit funding, probing denied industry ties. The debate erupts: they decry the

    as informed fools unworthy of court protection. Josh counters fiercely with evidence
    of corporate deceit and nicotine addiction, slamming their inaction with a brutal
    stat on 2800 new underage smokers daily before storming out. This escalation excavates
    Josh''s moral fury against cynical legalism, amplifying the human toll subplot

  title: Abbey Nurses Exhausted Sam, Babish Exposes Prescription Violations
  description: In a rare moment of intimate respite amid the MS crisis chaos, First
    Lady and physician Abbey Bartlet diagnoses Deputy Communications Director Sam's
    benign positional vertigo—linked to his MS-related fatigue—with professorial care
    and humorous aspirin banter, humanizing their bond. Oliver Babish abruptly interrupts,
    dismisses Sam, and launches a surgical legal interrogation, revealing Abbey's
    unauthorized Interferon prescriptions for President Bartlet, shipped across states,
    violating ethics boards in New Hampshire, Arizona, and Missouri. Abbey fiercely
    defends her 'extraordinary circumstances' loyalty, but Babish demands independent
    counsel, escalating personal devotion against inexorable legal peril and fracturing
    the administration's fragile unity.

    addressed as ''Dr. Bartlet'' and secure independent counsel immediately. He methodically
    exposes her legal peril: prescribing Interferon Beta 1-b without records, filling

  title: Oliver Exposes Dr. Bartlet's MS Prescription Violations
  description: 'After Sam departs, Oliver Babish confronts Abbey, insisting she be
    addressed as ''Dr. Bartlet'' and secure independent counsel immediately. He methodically
    exposes her legal peril: prescribing Interferon Beta 1-b without records, filling
    scripts at Dunwich Clinic and shipping to Phoenix and St. Louis, violating medical
    ethics in New Hampshire, Arizona, and Missouri. Abbey defiantly justifies her
    actions as extraordinary spousal care, lining up expert defenders. Oliver silently
    exits with his book, amplifying the cover-up''s personal toll and internal White
    House fractures amid spiraling crises.'

  description: In the Outer Oval Office, Charlie stands frozen, gripping the phone

  summary: 'The episode plunges into the White House basement, where President Bartlet
    and his inner circle confront the brutal reality of Joey Lucas''s poll numbers.
    The data rips through their carefully constructed world: a mere 17% forgive Bartlet''s
    concealed MS diagnosis, while a staggering 71% recoil from voting for a sick leader.
    Women over 55, a crucial demographic, abandon him en masse, and even loyal Democrats
    fracture, poisoned by the lie. The most damning revelation: 74% of voters mistakenly
    believe MS is fatal. Bartlet absorbs the gut punch, his quiet admission, "They
    may be right," hanging heavy in the air. This act masterfully establishes the
    central, crushing internal conflict: the political death sentence looming over
    a presidency built on trust, now shattered by a hidden illness. The urgency is
    palpable, setting the stage for a desperate fight for survival, immediately raising
    the stakes for Bartlet''s leadership and the integrity of his administration.
    The initial shock and disbelief among his senior staff underscore the monumental
    challenge ahead, as the political landscape shifts dramatically under their feet.
    This opening salvo defines the core mission: somehow navigate this treacherous

  summary: 'As dawn breaks, the White House plunges into a dual crisis. In Haiti,
    Colonel Bazan''s forces unleash chaos, crushing a victory rally and making president-elect
    Dessaline vanish, forcing his desperate flight towards U.S. asylum. Bartlet, haunted
    by past tragedies, immediately orders a non-essential embassy evacuation and Marine
    reinforcement, escalating the international stakes despite warnings of a dangerous
    standoff. Simultaneously, the domestic battle rages as C.J., Josh, Sam, and Toby
    frantically strategize the public revelation of Bartlet''s MS. C.J. champions
    a high-stakes, live Dateline special with the President and First Lady, followed
    by a press conference, aiming to control the narrative. Sam, however, pierces
    the frantic planning with the unanswerable question: will Bartlet seek re-election?
    This act expertly layers an external geopolitical powder keg atop the internal
    political implosion, demonstrating the immense pressure on the administration.
    Amidst this, the mundane charm of Mrs. Landingham''s new car purchase offers a
    brief, humanizing counterpoint, while Josh unearths deep-seated political corruption
    blocking a critical tobacco lawsuit, hinting at the entrenched battles ahead.
    The relentless pace and intersecting crises force the team to make immediate,
    high-consequence decisions, setting the stage for an even more volatile future.'

  summary: The Haitian crisis explodes as Dessaline, hidden in Jake Bratt's car trunk,
    breaches the U.S. embassy gates. Bartlet, against the counsel of caution, makes
    the decisive, high-stakes call to grant asylum, transforming a volatile situation
    into an official standoff with Bazan's encircling, U.S.-armed forces. The threat

    MS diagnosis to Donna Moss, her quiet, steeling resolve a testament to the loyalty
    this administration commands, even in the face of betrayal. This act masterfully

  summary: 'The administration grapples with the escalating consequences of its dual
    crises. C.J. faces a barrage of press questions regarding the military deployment
    to Haiti, deflecting inquiries about invasion while fiercely protecting the narrative.
    Her subsequent, high-stakes negotiation with network head Paul Hackett secures
    the live, logo-free Dateline special for the President and First Lady, a testament

    confronts the cynical reality of political obstruction, accusing Congressmen Warren
    and Rossiter of "politically correct extortion" for blocking tobacco lawsuit funding,
    his impassioned plea highlighting the human cost of their inaction. The most devastating
    internal front opens as Sam and Oliver Babish rigorously interrogate Abbey Bartlet.

    records. Babish, recognizing her profound legal exposure, urges her to secure
    independent counsel and reconsider the broadcast, yet Abbey''s unwavering resolve
    to stand by her husband burns fiercely. The Haitian situation then erupts into
    tragic violence: three Haitian soldiers are shot and killed on the runway while
    attempting to board the evacuating C-9. Bartlet''s fury clashes with Leo''s grim
    defense of the rules of engagement, as diplomatic whispers reveal Bazan''s demand
    for Dessaline on embezzlement charges. Amidst this maelstrom, Bartlet, shaken
    by the day''s events, finally commits to addressing the critical re-election question
    with his staff, setting a 9 PM meeting that promises to define their future.'
