  title: C.J. Rebels Against Simon's Overprotectiveness, Discovers Sabotaged Mustang
  description: Outside C.J.'s office, C.J. explodes in frustration at Simon's incessant
    shadowing since Finland, demanding to drive her cherished '65 Mustang home alone
    for a taste of freedom. Simon calmly reveals he's preemptively disabled the car
    by removing the spark plug, battery, fuel pump, and more, asserting unyielding
    control under the guise of duty. This raw clash exposes C.J.'s chafing autonomy
    amid constant surveillance and foreshadows Simon's trauma-fueled vigilance amid
    rising threats, deepening their tense dynamic as a setup for personal peril.

    Sam urgently interrupts outside her office, clutching an anonymously mailed videotape
    of a vicious opposition ad. He plays it inside: a voiceover invokes honor and

    a clean campaign pledge, and hiding secrets—ominously alluding to his concealed
    MS. C.J. demands the sender''s identity, but Sam''s ignorance deepens the mystery,
    igniting campaign paranoia and foreshadowing a calculated political ambush.'

  title: Bruno Exposes MS-Targeting Ad as Devastating Weapon, Staff Rejects Sam's
    Risky Confrontation
  description: In the basement room, senior staff watches a leaked opposition ad slyly
    questioning Bartlet's 'secrets' via honor, truth, and morality—Bruno instantly
    decodes it as a lethal strike at his concealed MS, a 'drawer' weapon meant to
    intimidate rivals. Sam impulsively pushes to confront Ritchie emissary Kevin Kahn
    for transparency, but Josh, Toby, C.J., and Bruno unanimously shut it down, fearing
    traps or leaks. Bruno pledges to consult Leo, Toby slips out amid media duties,
    and Bruno's piercing stare at C.J. heightens paranoia, turning internal unity
    into suspicion and amplifying the existential threat to Bartlet's candidacy.

  title: Toby's Sarcastic Gambit Crumbles Against Media's Coverage Slash
  description: Toby strides into the Roosevelt Room, launching with biting sarcasm
    about a trap-door awards show to assert dominance over media directors. He apologizes
    for past convention lapses like skyboxes and spinners, pledges better surrogates
    and floor access, and touts an engaging program with real people, keynotes, and
    panels. But the directors stun him by proposing to slash coverage to a single
    hour per convention—acceptance speeches only. Toby laughs it off in disbelief,
    yet their stone-faced seriousness signals a dire threat to Democratic visibility,
    fueling Toby's media war amid White House crises and setting up antitrust escalation.

  title: Bartlet Teases Leo with Plantagenet Self-Comparison
  description: Striding down the White House hallway toward the Situation Room, President
    Bartlet and Leo McGarry share a lighthearted banter about a 'War of the Roses'
    charity event reenacting Plantagenet history. Bartlet enthuses over its spectacle
    to assuage Leo's reluctance about the four-to-five-hour commitment, quipping they'll
    raise money for Catholic charities. At the door, Bartlet playfully asks which
    Plantagenet he resembles, but Leo pragmatically motions inside. This brief, witty
    exchange highlights their intimate camaraderie and provides crucial levity, humanizing
    the leaders before plunging into a terror threat briefing.

    NSA-monitored Syrian websites, Kazakh advisors, and Russian intel—to U.S. military
    installations like Bahrain's Fifth Fleet and Incirlik within 48 hours. Referencing
    the Helsinki reactor crisis, Bartlet decisively approves General's Force Protection
    Delta (limiting movements) and Admiral's harbor directives for carriers, demanding
    half-hourly updates regardless of new intel. As he exits, the standing Joint Chiefs

  title: Bartlet Greenlights Force Protection Delta Against Bahji Base Threat
  description: Transitioning from hallway banter, President Bartlet enters the Situation
    Room where Fitzwallace delivers a dire briefing on a credible Bahji cell threat—via
    NSA-monitored Syrian websites, Kazakh advisors, and Russian intel—to U.S. military
    installations like Bahrain's Fifth Fleet and Incirlik within 48 hours. Referencing
    the Helsinki reactor crisis, Bartlet decisively approves General's Force Protection
    Delta (limiting movements) and Admiral's harbor directives for carriers, demanding
    half-hourly updates regardless of new intel. As he exits, the standing Joint Chiefs
    affirm his commanding presence, escalating the terror plot while showcasing Bartlet's
    unflinching leadership amid layered crises.

  title: Bartlet Greenlights Force Protection Delta Against Bahji Base Threat
  description: Transitioning from hallway banter, President Bartlet enters the Situation
    Room where Fitzwallace delivers a dire briefing on a credible Bahji cell threat—via
    NSA-monitored Syrian websites, Kazakh advisors, and Russian intel—to U.S. military
    installations like Bahrain's Fifth Fleet and Incirlik within 48 hours. Referencing
    the Helsinki reactor crisis, Bartlet decisively approves General's Force Protection
    Delta (limiting movements) and Admiral's harbor directives for carriers, demanding
    half-hourly updates regardless of new intel. As he exits, the standing Joint Chiefs
    affirm his commanding presence, escalating the terror plot while showcasing Bartlet's
    unflinching leadership amid layered crises.

  title: Bartlet Greenlights Force Protection Delta Against Bahji Base Threat
  description: Transitioning from hallway banter, President Bartlet enters the Situation
    Room where Fitzwallace delivers a dire briefing on a credible Bahji cell threat—via
    NSA-monitored Syrian websites, Kazakh advisors, and Russian intel—to U.S. military
    installations like Bahrain's Fifth Fleet and Incirlik within 48 hours. Referencing
    the Helsinki reactor crisis, Bartlet decisively approves General's Force Protection
    Delta (limiting movements) and Admiral's harbor directives for carriers, demanding
    half-hourly updates regardless of new intel. As he exits, the standing Joint Chiefs
    affirm his commanding presence, escalating the terror plot while showcasing Bartlet's
    unflinching leadership amid layered crises.

  title: Bartlet Greenlights Force Protection Delta Against Bahji Base Threat
  description: Transitioning from hallway banter, President Bartlet enters the Situation
    Room where Fitzwallace delivers a dire briefing on a credible Bahji cell threat—via
    NSA-monitored Syrian websites, Kazakh advisors, and Russian intel—to U.S. military
    installations like Bahrain's Fifth Fleet and Incirlik within 48 hours. Referencing
    the Helsinki reactor crisis, Bartlet decisively approves General's Force Protection
    Delta (limiting movements) and Admiral's harbor directives for carriers, demanding
    half-hourly updates regardless of new intel. As he exits, the standing Joint Chiefs
    affirm his commanding presence, escalating the terror plot while showcasing Bartlet's
    unflinching leadership amid layered crises.

  title: Bartlet Greenlights Force Protection Delta Against Bahji Base Threat
  description: Transitioning from hallway banter, President Bartlet enters the Situation
    Room where Fitzwallace delivers a dire briefing on a credible Bahji cell threat—via
    NSA-monitored Syrian websites, Kazakh advisors, and Russian intel—to U.S. military
    installations like Bahrain's Fifth Fleet and Incirlik within 48 hours. Referencing
    the Helsinki reactor crisis, Bartlet decisively approves General's Force Protection
    Delta (limiting movements) and Admiral's harbor directives for carriers, demanding
    half-hourly updates regardless of new intel. As he exits, the standing Joint Chiefs
    affirm his commanding presence, escalating the terror plot while showcasing Bartlet's
    unflinching leadership amid layered crises.

  title: Bartlet Greenlights Force Protection Delta Against Bahji Base Threat
  description: Transitioning from hallway banter, President Bartlet enters the Situation
    Room where Fitzwallace delivers a dire briefing on a credible Bahji cell threat—via
    NSA-monitored Syrian websites, Kazakh advisors, and Russian intel—to U.S. military
    installations like Bahrain's Fifth Fleet and Incirlik within 48 hours. Referencing
    the Helsinki reactor crisis, Bartlet decisively approves General's Force Protection
    Delta (limiting movements) and Admiral's harbor directives for carriers, demanding
    half-hourly updates regardless of new intel. As he exits, the standing Joint Chiefs
    affirm his commanding presence, escalating the terror plot while showcasing Bartlet's
    unflinching leadership amid layered crises.

  title: Toby's Sarcastic Showdown with Media Directors Over Convention 'Infomercial'
  description: In the Roosevelt Room, Toby Ziegler, fueled by his relentless crusade
    for public access to political spectacle, sarcastically confronts media directors,
    accusing them of posturing with threats to gut convention coverage and mocking
    their demands with absurd concessions like nightly Rules Committee votes or the
    secretary eating a jellyfish. A director fires back defensively, asserting their
    passion for real news while dismissing the Democratic convention as a predictable,
    inconsequential 'four-day infomercial'—offering only acceptance speeches and balloons.
    This charged clash excavates media cynicism versus White House idealism, escalating
    press tensions amid terror threats and leaks, serving as a thematic microcosm
    of democracy's battle for visibility.

    of Rules Committee out of the convention every night or something? The secretary
    should eat a jellyfish?"'
  - 'MAN: "You know what sir, don''t talk to me like I''m other people. The four of
    us are news directors and there isn''t a day that one of us isn''t begging the
    person we work for to let us for the love of Jesus Christ do the news. [...] And
    you''re getting huffed because the four of us are questioning the wisdom of presenting
    a four-day infomercial, in primetime, under network news, simulcast? We''ll show
    the acceptance speeches. And the balloons. The balloons aren''t news but it''s

  title: C.J. Banters with Simon Over 'Flamingo' Protocols, Confides Aging Insecurities
    to Carol
  description: C.J. enters her office ribbing Simon about her embarrassing 'Flamingo'
    Secret Service code name and announces a lunch shopping trip for niece Hogan's
    Junior Prom dress. Simon lays out rigid protocols—walking ahead, maintaining five
    feet proximity, no ditching—emphasizing her recognizability and his hands-free
    readiness, sparking C.J.'s sassy resistance. Afterward, she vulnerably dissects
    her unnatural correction of 'Junior Prom' to Carol, exposing self-consciousness
    about aging in the young agent's gaze, blending professional friction with personal
    unease as a setup for their evolving dynamic amid threats.

    insistence on correcting him about 'Junior Prom' versus 'Prom' with assistant
    Carol, exposing raw fears of seeming 'old enough to be the aunt' in the attractive

  title: Josh Confronts Donna Over Intern's eBay Moose Meat Sale
  description: As Donna exits the assistants' salary leak meeting, Josh intercepts
    her, eagerly asking if she tried his gifted Finnish moose meat. Stunned, he reveals
    it's auctioned on eBay for $180 by an intern she gave it to, who she dismisses
    as unworthy without a 'prize.' Hurt by the casual rejection of his quirky personal
    gesture, Josh demands she fire the intern immediately. Donna freezes, promising
    to handle it, their banter exposing affectionate tensions in their boss-assistant
    dynamic and offering humorous relief from mounting White House crises like the
    MS leak and terror threats.

    a U.S. map. The terror threat escalates as targets expand to Dover Air Force Base
    and Fort Myer—bases unnervingly proximate to the White House. Intelligence pins
    Mohammad Sabeh's Bahji Cell, armed with smuggled weapons of unknown power. Leo's
    shocked reaction and tactical questions excavate the peril's logic, transforming
    a vague threat into a White House siege. This revelation surges stakes, propelling

  title: Bruno Warns Leo of Damaging Tape and Transcript Risks
  description: Bruno banters awkwardly with Margaret, misnaming her before handing
    her a mysterious gift box (a personalized necklace). Entering Leo's office, the
    shrewd strategist pushes for Iowa political appointments, invoking Andrew Jackson's
    quip, then presses on President Bartlet's transcript refusal—deflected by Leo's
    tap-dancing joke. Bruno ominously warns of a tape too explosive for TV, underscoring
    the administration's precarious vulnerabilities amid terror plots and attack ads.
    This pivotal exchange amplifies political tensions, revealing Bruno's pragmatic
    urgency against Leo's measured caution, setting up broader crises.

  title: Donna's Tenacious Plea Spares the Moose Sausage Intern
  description: In Josh's office, Donna bursts in to challenge his order to fire intern
    Bruce for selling Josh's gifted Finnish moose sausage on eBay, framing it as a
    minor ethical lapse amid interns' financial struggles. She invokes declining public
    service recruitment stats from the Kennedy School and a past incident where Josh
    protected her identity from Martha's suspicions, underscoring reciprocal loyalty.
    Though Josh relents quickly, Donna hammers her point home, culminating in their
    playful banter that affirms her sway over him. This comic breather reinforces
    staff bonds and Donna's moral influence amid White House chaos, contrasting high-stakes
    crises.

  title: Bartlet Defies Bunker Evacuation Amid Escalating Terror Intel
  description: 'In the Oval Office portico, President Bartlet receives urgent briefing
    from Leo, Fitzwallace, and advisors: FBI traces Bahji comms to Khaled Madani (aka
    Abdul Al-Yossi) in Bethesda, whose raided duplex yields detailed blueprints of
    the National Archives and Supreme Court. Bartlet probes Shareef''s non-cooperation.
    Rejecting Leo''s Marine One push and Fitzwallace''s grounding advice, Bartlet—alone
    with Leo—fiercely refuses the bunker to stay with the people, evacuates only Abby,
    threatens resignation to Hoynes if forced, and demands reinforced security. This
    turning point crystallizes Bartlet''s unyielding leadership, heightening terror
    stakes and foreshadowing diplomatic fallout.'

  title: Bartlet Defies Bunker Evacuation Amid Escalating Terror Intel
  description: 'In the Oval Office portico, President Bartlet receives urgent briefing
    from Leo, Fitzwallace, and advisors: FBI traces Bahji comms to Khaled Madani (aka
    Abdul Al-Yossi) in Bethesda, whose raided duplex yields detailed blueprints of
    the National Archives and Supreme Court. Bartlet probes Shareef''s non-cooperation.
    Rejecting Leo''s Marine One push and Fitzwallace''s grounding advice, Bartlet—alone
    with Leo—fiercely refuses the bunker to stay with the people, evacuates only Abby,
    threatens resignation to Hoynes if forced, and demands reinforced security. This
    turning point crystallizes Bartlet''s unyielding leadership, heightening terror

  title: Bartlet Defies Bunker Evacuation Amid Escalating Terror Intel
  description: 'In the Oval Office portico, President Bartlet receives urgent briefing
    from Leo, Fitzwallace, and advisors: FBI traces Bahji comms to Khaled Madani (aka
    Abdul Al-Yossi) in Bethesda, whose raided duplex yields detailed blueprints of
    the National Archives and Supreme Court. Bartlet probes Shareef''s non-cooperation.
    Rejecting Leo''s Marine One push and Fitzwallace''s grounding advice, Bartlet—alone
    with Leo—fiercely refuses the bunker to stay with the people, evacuates only Abby,
    threatens resignation to Hoynes if forced, and demands reinforced security. This
    turning point crystallizes Bartlet''s unyielding leadership, heightening terror
    stakes and foreshadowing diplomatic fallout.'

  title: Donna Confronts Intern Bruce Over eBay Moose Meat Fiasco
  description: In the White House Mess, Donna pulls aside unpaid intern Bruce, confronting
    him for selling Josh's bizarre Finnish moose meat gift—a White House property—on
    eBay. Dismayed, she hammers the embarrassment it causes her, Josh, the President,
    and the entire staff, emphasizing institutional pride. Bruce brazenly dismisses
    her, claiming he's not 'official' staff since he's unpaid, undercutting her authority
    and exposing raw tensions between loyal aides and entitled interns amid national
    crises, serving as a thematic parallel to ethical boundary tests in public service.

  title: Toby's Antitrust Threat Secures Full Convention Coverage
  description: Toby re-enters the Roosevelt Room meeting with media directors, boldly
    countering their offer by demanding gavel-to-gavel coverage of all four convention
    nights. Facing skepticism, he invokes public ownership of airwaves and FCC obligations,
    then escalates with a pointed antitrust threat under 15 U.S.C. Section 1, accusing
    them of collusive restraint of trade. His passionate plea for democratic transparency—highlighting
    leaders speaking directly to the public amid balloons—lands as the directors concede,
    agreeing to consult lawyers. This turning-point victory ensures critical media
    exposure, fortifying the Bartlet campaign against the MS leak crisis.

  description: In a torrential downpour outside Dupont Towers, idealistic Sam confronts
    treacherous Kahn over the leaked attack ad, shoving him in raw betrayal-fueled

  title: Bartlet Demands Proof of Shareef's Golden Gate Terror Link
  description: In the Oval Office, Leo and Fitzwallace brief President Bartlet on
    the Coast Guard's interception of a boat off Oakland carrying 5000 keys of ammonium
    nitrate and diesel fuel, targeted at Fort Point to destroy the Golden Gate Bridge—a
    site absent from prior threat lists. Russian interrogations of a Chechen prisoner
    link the plot to Qumari Defense Minister Abdul Shareef via a Bahji operative.
    Bartlet, stunned by the implications with Shareef's visit imminent, demands conclusive
    evidence, issuing a stark ultimatum that transforms a foiled attack into a diplomatic
    powder keg and tests his administration's resolve.

  title: Bartlet Demands Proof of Shareef's Golden Gate Terror Link
  description: In the Oval Office, Leo and Fitzwallace brief President Bartlet on
    the Coast Guard's interception of a boat off Oakland carrying 5000 keys of ammonium
    nitrate and diesel fuel, targeted at Fort Point to destroy the Golden Gate Bridge—a
    site absent from prior threat lists. Russian interrogations of a Chechen prisoner
    link the plot to Qumari Defense Minister Abdul Shareef via a Bahji operative.
    Bartlet, stunned by the implications with Shareef's visit imminent, demands conclusive
    evidence, issuing a stark ultimatum that transforms a foiled attack into a diplomatic
    powder keg and tests his administration's resolve.

  summary: Sam Seaborn bursts into the White House, clutching a mysterious opposition
    attack ad that viciously tears at President Bartlet's integrity, hinting at his
    concealed MS. Simultaneously, C.J. Cregg clashes with her new Secret Service detail,
    Simon Donovan, whose protective measures extend to disabling her beloved Mustang,
    trapping her in a web of constant vigilance. The senior staff reels from the ad's
    implications, Bruno Gianelli immediately diagnosing it as a weapon aimed at Bartlet's
    MS secret. Sam, ever the idealist, pushes for a direct confrontation with Ritchie's
    campaign, a move met with unanimous opposition and distrust. Meanwhile, Toby Ziegler
    battles media executives threatening to gut convention coverage, fighting for
    the public's right to full political spectacle. A more sinister shadow falls as
    the Joint Chiefs brief President Bartlet on an imminent terrorist attack targeting
    U.S. military installations, escalating the stakes beyond political maneuvering
    to national security. The White House braces for unseen enemies, both political
    and existential, as the initial shockwaves of multiple crises ripple through its
    hallowed halls.
  key_moments:
  - Sam discovers the anonymous, devastating opposition attack ad targeting President
    Bartlet's integrity.
  - C.J. faces Simon Donovan's unyielding Secret Service protection, her Mustang rendered
    immobile.
  - Bruno Gianelli definitively identifies the attack ad as a veiled assault on Bartlet's
    MS secret.
  - Toby Ziegler confronts media directors threatening to drastically cut convention
    coverage, signaling a battle for public airwaves.
  - President Bartlet receives an urgent Joint Chiefs briefing on a credible, imminent

  summary: Toby Ziegler intensifies his verbal war with the media directors, refusing
    to yield the public airwaves to their infomercial demands, while C.J. endures
    Simon Donovan's relentless, almost suffocating protection during a shopping trip
    with her niece, Hogan. Simon's unsettling vigilance, born from past trauma, casts
    a long shadow over C.J.'s personal life, even as she grapples with her own self-consciousness
    about aging. Josh Lyman discovers his Finnish moose meat, a quirky souvenir, has
    landed on eBay via a rogue intern, sparking a debate with Donna Moss about the
    value of unpaid public service. Sam Seaborn, despite warnings, initiates a lunch
    with Kevin Kahn, Ritchie's campaign emissary, hoping to foster civility, unaware
    of the trap being laid. The terror threat escalates dramatically, the target list
    expanding to include Dover, Fort Myer, and chillingly, the White House itself.
    President Bartlet, defiant, refuses to retreat to the bunker, his resolve unyielding
    even as the threat tightens its grip, hinting at a deeper, more insidious conspiracy
    involving Abdul Shareef. The pressure mounts, exposing vulnerabilities across
    the political, personal, and national security fronts.
  key_moments:
  - Toby Ziegler fiercely negotiates with media directors, who threaten to drastically
    reduce convention programming.
  - C.J. Cregg's shopping trip with her niece, Hogan, highlights Simon Donovan's intense,
    almost obsessive protective instincts and his past trauma.
  - Josh Lyman discovers his moose meat gift has been sold on eBay by an intern, igniting
    a debate on public service compensation.
  - Sam Seaborn meets Kevin Kahn, attempting to establish a diplomatic channel, unknowingly
    walking into a political ambush.
  - The terror target list expands to include the White House, forcing President Bartlet
    to defiantly refuse evacuation to the bunker.

  summary: 'Donna Moss confronts intern Bruce, forcing him to return the eBay profits
    from the moose meat, underscoring the White House''s strict ethical boundaries.
    Bruno Gianelli unleashes a furious tirade on C.J. and Sam, revealing Sam''s lunch
    with Kevin Kahn was a calculated leak, weaponizing the clean campaign pledge against
    Bartlet. Toby Ziegler, seizing on the media directors'' collusion, leverages antitrust
    threats from the Justice Department to force their full convention coverage, a
    strategic victory in the battle for public attention. A rain-soaked confrontation
    erupts between Sam and Kahn, old wounds from an open mic incident fueling Kahn''s
    calculated betrayal, proving Bruno''s axiom: all warfare deceives. The immediate
    terror threat culminates as the Coast Guard intercepts ammonium nitrate off Oakland,
    intended for the Golden Gate Bridge, not D.C. The Russians confirm Abdul Shareef''s
    direct involvement in the plot, transforming a national security crisis into a
    diplomatic powder keg. As the White House staff grapples with the fallout, a chilling
    email arrives for C.J., a death threat explicitly mentioning her black Vera Wang
    gown, plunging her into a new, deeply personal terror, leaving Simon Donovan to
    slam his fist in a violent surge of protective rage.'
