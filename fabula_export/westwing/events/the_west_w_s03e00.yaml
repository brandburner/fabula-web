  title: FBI Agents Uncover Terror Aliases, Trigger White House Alert
  description: In the FBI Field Office in Burlington, Vermont, Agent Greg urgently
    directs Joan to run an NCIC search on 'Yaarun Nabi,' which she recognizes as Persian
    for 'Friend of the Prophet.' The search yields four aliases—Yaquin Kashani, Raqim
    Ali, Yamin Bandari, Yawar Aryanpur—prompting deeper checks. Joan's stunned reaction
    draws Greg to the screen, revealing critical hits linking one alias to a White
    House staffer. Greg immediately calls the Secret Service Joint Operations Center,
    igniting the Code Black lockdown that serves as the story's explosive inciting
    incident and causal pivot to the central drama of profiling and extremism.

  title: Josh's Awkward Intro Interrupted by Code Black
  description: Exhausted Josh enters the Northwest Lobby to fulfill his reluctant
    promise, stumbling through a greeting by blanking on 'Presidential Classroom'—prompted
    by Donna—before Marjorie Mann formally introduces herself and explains the students'
    competitive selection. His clumsy travel query draws a deadpan 'Bus' response,
    prompting a rushed professional bio. Chaos erupts as the red 'Crash' phone flashes;
    the guard declares 'Code Black,' Secret Service agents swarm, and Josh instinctively
    reassures the frightened students, claiming responsibility. This humanizes his
    authority, transforming obligatory small talk into crisis leadership amid rising
    lockdown tension.

  title: Crash Phone Triggers Code Black, Trapping Josh with Students
  description: As Josh awkwardly continues his self-introduction to the Presidential
    Classroom students, a flashing red 'Crash' phone shatters the casual moment. The
    Guard answers, declaring 'Code Black, crash!', prompting Secret Service agents

    calming the startled students and claiming responsibility for them when questioned,
    transforming him from bumbling host to reluctant protector amid post-9/11 terror
    fears. This turning point locks them together, priming intense debates on security
    and pluralism.

    Mess, directing them to grab seats and wait out the lockdown, providing a steadying
    presence. Agitated Josh arrives, pressing her for details and instructing her

    addresses the group, authoritatively explaining the 'crash' protocol—a security
    breach barring entry or exit—while nervously reiterating the call to Leo, masking

  title: Josh Playfully Duels Billy over Branch Powers
  description: As Josh lectures on government branches during the lockdown, sharp-witted
    student Billy Fernandez interrupts, arguing the Executive is constitutionally
    weakest compared to the Legislative 'People's Branch.' Josh halts menacingly with
    a smirk, dubs him 'Fred,' quips 'a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing'
    and adds him to his 'list,' before conceding technically but touting motorcade
    perks. This spirited spar reveals Josh's razor wit, ignites competitive banter,
    humanizes the lecture, and builds rapport with wary students, signaling rising
    room energy.

    isn''t that why they made the Legislative branch-or People''s Branch-the most
    powerful?"'

    ('Freddy') to fetch apples and peanut butter from the kitchen, a folksy touch

  title: Secret Service Storms Raqim Ali's Office
  description: In a dimly lit office in the Old Executive Office Building at 5:22
    PM, innocent Arab-American staffer Raqim Ali smokes pensively by the window. Alerted
    by the rattling doorknob, he tosses his cigarette just as Ron Butterfield and
    armed Secret Service agents kick in the door, guns drawn. A startled Raqim raises
    his trembling hands as Butterfield demands confirmation of his identity and orders
    him away from the window for questioning. This explosive raid, payoff to the NCIC
    alias match, embodies post-9/11 paranoia, profiling an innocent man and ratcheting
    lockdown tension toward interrogation.

  title: Toby's Dark Humor and Taliban-Nazi Analogy
  description: Toby Ziegler strides into the White House Mess amid the post-9/11 lockdown,
    taking center stage before the trapped high school students after Josh's exit.
    With biting dark humor, he envisions surgically eliminating extremists while sparing
    sacred icons like the Koran and mosques, then delivers a chilling analogy equating
    the Taliban to Nazis and Afghanistan to invaded Poland. This exposes the regime's
    barbaric core beneath a moderate veneer, escalating emotional tension, reinforcing
    thematic parallels to extremism's masks (like Josh's KKK point), and deepening
    the students' lesson on discerning true evil amid fear-driven profiling.

  title: Leo's Prejudice-Laden Grill of Raqim Ali
  description: In a shadowed White House office during the post-9/11 lockdown, Chief
    of Staff Leo McGarry aggressively interrogates innocent Arab-American staffer
    Raqim Ali about a wire in his backpack (dismissed as computer repair), his MIT

    and his father's donation to 'Holy Land Defender.' Ali cooperates initially but
    explodes in fury at the familial probe, defiantly retorting amid Leo's insistence
    on the crisis's gravity. This raw standoff exposes Leo's bias, tests Ali's dignity,
    sets up Leo's future apology, and crystallizes the human toll of suspicion-fueled

  title: Agent Probes Ali's Unpermitted Rally Arrest
  description: 'In the shadowy confines of a dark office during the White House lockdown,
    the Agent sharply questions Raqim Ali about his arrest two years earlier. Ali
    defensively affirms it but insists charges were dropped. The Agent discloses the
    specifics: an unpermitted rally, instantly linking Ali''s past activism to suspicions
    of radical Islamist sympathies. This pivotal revelation ratchets interrogation
    tension, framing innocent protest as potential terrorism precursor and deepening
    the narrative''s exploration of profiling amid national panic.'

  title: C.J. and Josh's Sarcastic Clash Over Intel Support
  description: Amid the lockdown tension, C.J. sarcastically equates coalition-building
    to John Wayne assembling a posse while addressing students, prompting Josh's biting
    retort on her example. She jabs that he should aid the intelligence team, drawing
    Josh's crude suggestion she comfort them in fishnets post-crisis, which she deadpans
    she'll do. This sharp, sexually charged banter exposes fraying team dynamics,
    C.J.'s hawkish push for aggressive intel work clashing with Josh's frustration,
    underscoring professional rifts and contrasting crisis strategies before student
    questions pivot the scene.

  title: 'Poverty Incubates Terror: Sam and Charlie''s Gang Parallel'
  description: A student interrupts the C.J.-Josh sparring by asking where terrorists
    come from, sparking a pivotal debate on extremism's roots. Sam attributes it to
    abject poverty as a global incubator for crime, but Charlie counters sharply,
    equating it to inner-city gang life in Southeast D.C.—offering dignity, belonging,
    and pride to the marginalized. This exchange humanizes terrorism's allure, bridging
    international threats to American urban decay, deepening thematic layers on despair's
    universal pull amid lockdown anxiety and setting up contrasts with heroic ideals.

  description: A student interrupts the C.J.-Josh sparring by asking where terrorists
    come from, sparking a pivotal debate on extremism's roots. Sam attributes it to
    abject poverty as a global incubator for crime, but Charlie counters sharply,
    equating it to inner-city gang life in Southeast D.C.—offering dignity, belonging,

  title: 'Poverty Incubates Terror: Sam and Charlie''s Gang Parallel'
  description: A student interrupts the C.J.-Josh sparring by asking where terrorists
    come from, sparking a pivotal debate on extremism's roots. Sam attributes it to
    abject poverty as a global incubator for crime, but Charlie counters sharply,
    equating it to inner-city gang life in Southeast D.C.—offering dignity, belonging,
    and pride to the marginalized. This exchange humanizes terrorism's allure, bridging
    international threats to American urban decay, deepening thematic layers on despair's
    universal pull amid lockdown anxiety and setting up contrasts with heroic ideals.

    trip and past mosque ties, but a messenger interrupts: the real suspect is in
    Germany. Ron departs swiftly, freeing Ali amid collective relief. As agents exit,
    Ali pauses to rebuke Leo''s hypocrisy, invoking the Rosslyn shooting by white
    supremacists to shatter assumptions of peril solely from Muslims. Leo sits frozen,

  title: Ali Exposes Leo's Hypocrisy with Rosslyn Shooting Reminder
  description: A messenger agent informs Ron the real suspect is in Germany, clearing
    Raqim Ali after intense interrogation on his Uzbekistan trip and mosque ties.
    Relieved, Ali rises to leave but halts, turning to confront the motionless Leo
    McGarry. With biting wit, Ali invokes the Rosslyn shooting—where white supremacists
    fired on a diverse group including himself—exposing Leo's selective memory and
    prejudice against Muslims. Leo stares blankly, a flicker of sadness betraying
    his dawning self-reflection, pivoting the scene from suspicion to thematic reckoning
    on hypocrisy and pluralism.

  title: Ali Exposes Leo's Hypocrisy with Rosslyn Shooting Reminder
  description: A messenger agent informs Ron the real suspect is in Germany, clearing
    Raqim Ali after intense interrogation on his Uzbekistan trip and mosque ties.
    Relieved, Ali rises to leave but halts, turning to confront the motionless Leo
    McGarry. With biting wit, Ali invokes the Rosslyn shooting—where white supremacists
    fired on a diverse group including himself—exposing Leo's selective memory and
    prejudice against Muslims. Leo stares blankly, a flicker of sadness betraying
    his dawning self-reflection, pivoting the scene from suspicion to thematic reckoning
    on hypocrisy and pluralism.

    with solemn stiffness, awkwardly apologizing for his earlier prejudiced jabs about
    Ali's features resembling criminals and Muslim women driving, blaming the heightened
    stress from the crisis and his shooting trauma. A heavy silence ensues as Ali
    silently evaluates Leo's sincerity. As Leo turns to leave, he hesitates, softly

  summary: The episode opens with the cast of The West Wing, including Martin Sheen,
    Rob Lowe, Allison Janney, John Spencer, Dulé Hill, Bradley Whitford, Richard Schiff,
    Stockard Channing, and Janel Moloney, directly addressing the audience. They explain
    that this is a special, non-canonical episode dedicated to the victims and heroes
    of 9/11, with all profits going to relief funds. They emphasize its unique nature
    as a 'story-telling aberration' before previewing the upcoming third season's
    usual storylines. This meta-introduction immediately establishes the episode's
    somber tone and its purpose as a tribute. The narrative then plunges into an FBI
    field office in Burlington, Vermont, where Agent Greg initiates a search for 'Yaarun
    Nabi,' a Persian name meaning 'friend of the prophet.' The search yields several
    dangerous aliases, including 'Raqim Ali,' triggering an urgent, high-level alert.
    Simultaneously, in the White House, Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman prepares
    to leave for the day, only for Donna Moss to remind him of his commitment to speak
    to a group of high school students from Presidential Classroom. As Josh reluctantly
    heads to the northwest lobby, a Code Black is declared, sealing the White House
    in an immediate, ironclad lockdown. Secret Service agents swarm the building,
    instructing everyone to 'Stay where you are.' Josh, caught off guard, gathers
    the bewildered students, confirming they are 'with him' as the executive mansion
    becomes an unexpected, high-stakes prison.
  key_moments:
  - The cast directly addresses the audience, dedicating the episode to 9/11 victims
    and heroes.
  - FBI Agent Greg's NCIC search for 'Yaarun Nabi' reveals dangerous aliases, including
    'Raqim Ali'.
  - A 'Code Black' crash erupts at the White House, initiating a full lockdown.

  summary: 'Donna ushers the nervous high school students into the White House Mess,
    a makeshift sanctuary during the escalating crisis. Josh, pacing like a caged
    animal, attempts to explain the ''crash'' – a security breach sealing the building
    – but his own anxiety bleeds through. He orders Donna to contact Leo''s office,
    desperate for information. A sharp-witted student, Billy Fernandez, challenges
    Josh, asserting the Legislative Branch''s constitutional superiority over the
    Executive. Josh, adopting a menacing smirk, renames him ''Fred'' and playfully
    warns him, establishing a dynamic of intellectual sparring. Girl 1, cutting through
    the political jargon, directly asks, ''What''s the deal with everybody trying
    to kill you?'' This raw question prompts Josh to reveal his personal scars: the
    Rosslyn shooting and his mother''s emergency box filled with survival gear and
    sentimental items, including a signed Joe Pepitone cap. He then makes a fierce
    vow, declaring, ''We''re not leaving till we do'' (win big), revealing a deep-seated
    commitment to his work despite the personal cost. The students press further on
    the ''why us?'' question, leading Josh to the dry-erase board. He scrawls a provocative
    analogy: ''Islamic extremist is to Islamic as ''blank'' is to Christianity,''
    then fills the blank with ''KKK,'' forcefully distinguishing radical groups from
    the millions of patriotic Muslims serving the country. He details the absurdities
    of extremist interpretations of Islamic law, contrasting them with America''s
    pluralistic society, where diverse faiths, freedoms, and expressions thrive. As
    Josh leaves to gather ''smarter'' colleagues, the scene shifts abruptly to a darkened
    Old Executive Office Building room where Secret Service agents, led by Ron Butterfield,
    burst in, guns drawn, on a startled Raqim Ali, initiating his apprehension.'

  summary: 'Leo McGarry receives a chilling briefing from Ron Butterfield: Khuram
    Sharif, arrested for an attempted bombing, has named ''Yaarun Nabi'' as a co-conspirator,
    whose alias, Raqim Ali, works within the White House. The revelation hangs heavy,
    confirming Leo''s grim premonition that it was ''only a matter of time.'' The
    interrogation of Raqim Ali begins in a darkened office, focusing on his MIT degree
    in Applied Mathematics and his seemingly incongruous job as a White House staffer
    secretary, raising suspicions about his true intentions. Back in the White House
    Mess, Toby Ziegler, Deputy Communications Director, joins the students, initially
    bantering darkly about ''killing them all'' except for essential elements like
    the Yankees and good steak. He then shifts to a more serious tone, providing a
    stark political analogy for Islamic extremism: the Taliban to the Nazis, Afghanistan
    to Poland, and its citizens to Jews in concentration camps. Toby emphasizes that
    ''bad people can''t be recognized on sight,'' challenging simplistic profiling.
    Sam Seaborn, Deputy Communications Director, arrives, delving into the historical
    roots of terrorism, recounting the 11th-century ''Assassins'' cult, fueled by
    hashish and promises of paradise for murderous acts. Sam then powerfully asserts
    terrorism''s ''100% failure rate,'' citing examples like the IRA and the Weathermen,
    contrasting their futility with the triumphs of non-violent movements like Gandhi''s
    and the Civil Rights Movement. He starkly reminds the students that societies
    like Israel live daily with the threat of random bombings. Meanwhile, Leo intensifies
    his interrogation of Ali, probing him about a ''wire'' found in his backpack,
    his father''s contribution to the ''Holy Land Defender,'' and a past protest.
    Ali''s anger flares as his father is implicated, leading Leo to deliver a cutting,
    prejudiced remark: ''Well, that''s the price you pay'' for looking like them,
    exposing a raw nerve of suspicion and racial profiling.'
  key_moments:
  - Leo McGarry learns that a suspected terrorist alias, Raqim Ali, works in the White
    House.
  - Toby Ziegler analogizes the Taliban to Nazis and Afghanistan's citizens to Jews,
    emphasizing that 'bad people can't be recognized on sight'.
  - Sam Seaborn explains the historical 'Assassins' cult and asserts terrorism's '100%
    failure rate'.
  - Leo interrogates Raqim Ali, probing his background and father's activities, escalating

  summary: 'The White House Mess becomes a crucible of debate as C.J. Cregg, Press
    Secretary, passionately advocates for robust intelligence gathering, including
    human spies, Arabic language training, phone tapping, and even ''busboys with
    silencers,'' asserting the necessity of Draconian measures in times of crisis.
    Billy Fernandez counters her with Benjamin Franklin''s timeless warning about
    sacrificing essential liberty for temporary safety. Toby challenges C.J. on the
    historical failures of such measures, like the blacklist, sparking a sharp exchange
    on civil liberties versus national security. Charlie Young, President Bartlet''s
    personal aide, offers a profound perspective, drawing a parallel between the allure
    of dignity and belonging offered by inner-city gangs in impoverished areas and
    the similar pull of terrorist groups. He highlights how both provide a sense of
    pride where conventional society fails. The dramatic tension peaks with the unexpected
    arrival of President Bartlet and First Lady Abbey Bartlet. Bartlet, with his characteristic
    gravitas, confronts a student''s naive question about the nobility of martyrdom,
    unequivocally condemning it as ''sick, twisted, brutal, dumb-ass murder.'' He
    champions heroes who ''live for'' their country, not die for it. Simultaneously,
    the interrogation of Raqim Ali intensifies, focusing on his past protest against
    U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia and a bomb threat at his high school. Leo McGarry''s
    prejudice surfaces explicitly with his cutting ''I can''t imagine why'' when Ali
    mentions Arab-Americans being first suspected. The climax of Ali''s ordeal arrives
    when a Secret Service agent bursts in with critical news: the *real* Yaarun Nabi
    alias has been located in Germany, unequivocally clearing Raqim Ali. Ali, though
    free, confronts Leo about the Rosslyn shooting, reminding him that the white shooters
    targeted diversity, a direct indictment of Leo''s earlier profiling.'
  key_moments:
  - C.J. Cregg fiercely advocates for aggressive intelligence tactics, including profiling
    and targeted assassinations.
  - Billy Fernandez cites Benjamin Franklin's warning about sacrificing liberty for
    safety, challenging C.J.'s stance.
  - Charlie Young draws a powerful parallel between inner-city gangs and terrorist
    groups, both offering dignity in despair.
  - President Bartlet vehemently condemns martyrdom as 'sick, twisted murder,' advocating
    for heroes who live for their country.
  - Raqim Ali is cleared as the true suspect is located in Germany, ending his interrogation.
  - Ali confronts Leo, reminding him of the white shooters at Rosslyn, exposing Leo's
    prejudice.

  summary: 'With Raqim Ali cleared, the immediate threat dissipates, but the lingering
    shadow of prejudice remains. Leo McGarry sits motionless, haunted by his earlier,
    biased remarks to Ali and the painful memory of the Rosslyn shooting, where white
    supremacists targeted diversity. In the White House Mess, Abbey Bartlet takes
    center stage, weaving the ancient narrative of Isaac and Ishmael, the sons of
    Abraham, whose descendants became Jews and Arabs. She emphasizes the crucial detail
    that, in the end, ''the two sons came together to bury their father,'' offering
    a powerful metaphor for reconciliation and shared humanity. Josh, ever the pragmatist,
    interjects with a touch of humor, reminding everyone of the story''s ancient origins.
    As the lockdown officially clears, Abbey departs, leaving Josh to deliver his
    final, poignant message to the students. He rejects the death penalty as too simple,
    instead proposing a chilling, empathetic ''punishment'' for terrorists: forcing
    them to watch home movies of their victims'' joyous life events, followed by nightly
    physical retribution. More importantly, he urges the students to embrace pluralism,
    declaring it the ultimate weapon against extremism: ''You want to get these people?
    Keep accepting more than one idea. Makes ''em absolutely crazy.'' As the students
    file out, Josh offers a quiet, meaningful encouragement to Billy Fernandez: ''Just
    keep doing what you''re doing,'' acknowledging his sharp intellect and questioning
    spirit. The narrative then returns to Ali''s office where Leo, stiff and uncomfortable,
    offers a raw, halting apology for his earlier ''price you pay'' comment and his
    crack about Muslim women driving. He struggles to articulate his remorse, attributing
    his behavior to the heightened stress. As Ali listens quietly, Leo''s final, soft
    words – ''Way to be back at your desk'' – resonate with a profound, hard-won understanding.
    The episode concludes with Buffalo Springfield''s ''For What It''s Worth,'' its
    lyrics underscoring the themes of vigilance, conflict, and the imperative to ''look
    what''s going down,'' cementing the episode''s message of confronting fear with
    pluralism and choosing heroes who live for peace.'

  - Abbey Bartlet recounts the story of Isaac and Ishmael, highlighting their eventual
    reconciliation.
  - Josh Lyman proposes a unique, empathetic 'punishment' for terrorists and urges
    students to embrace pluralism.
