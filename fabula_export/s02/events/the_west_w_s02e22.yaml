  title: 'Party Panic: Democrats Urge Leo to Block Bartlet''s Reelection'
  description: In Leo's office, panicked House Democrats Bill and Congressman Wade
    confront Leo over Bartlet's concealed MS diagnosis, warning it will devastate
    their party's House majority and trap the campaign in scandal. They bluntly plead
    for Bartlet to abandon reelection to salvage Democratic seats amid policy advantages
    against Republicans. Leo, stoic and battle-hardened, dismisses their urgency—he's
    fielded this demand from 35 others in hours—and redirects them to the imminent
    press conference, underscoring his unwavering loyalty while amplifying tension
    as a setup for Bartlet's defiant response.

    relays Leo's order to reinstate a meeting with Greg Summerhays, hinting at contingency

  title: Toby Capitulates to Leo's Override on Summerhays Meeting
  description: In the hectic White House hallway, as Toby juggles press conference
    logistics and Sam's concerns over the President's readiness, Ginger apologetically
    informs him that Leo's office has reinstated the 4 PM meeting with Greg Summerhays—news
    director offering Toby a 'lifeboat' job—which Toby had canceled. Despite protesting
    the grueling schedule amid Mrs. Landingham's funeral and crises, Toby pats Ginger's
    arm and yields with a resigned 'Yeah, all right.' This beat excavates hierarchy
    tensions, revealing Toby's pragmatic deference to Leo amid exhaustion, foreshadowing
    staff fractures in the administration's crisis.

    openly debate alternatives to VP Hoynes as Bartlet''s successor—naming Wetland,
    Hutchinson, and Gillette—citing fundraising prowess and contingency planning amid

    close notebooks, and declares Bartlet untouchable: not a mere candidate, but the
    President. This beat excavates staff-pragmatist conflict, reinforcing themes of

  title: Monohan's Resurrection Prayer Amid Shared Mourning
  description: In the soaring Washington National Cathedral, Abbey guides the weary
    President Bartlet to their front pew as Reverend Monohan ascends the pulpit to
    intone the Resurrection prayer for Mrs. Landingham. The camera sweeps over their
    stony faces—Bartlet exhaling heavily, Abbey steadfast beside him, staff like Leo,
    Toby, C.J., and tearful aides showing raw collective grief. As Monohan's words
    of eternal life echo, Bartlet's distant stare signals his emotional retreat, pierced
    by Young Mrs. Landingham's ghostly VO 'Jed!', bridging present loss to formative
    past and priming his defiant inner reckoning.

  title: Bartlet Drifts into Young Landingham's Haunting Voiceover
  description: As Reverend Monohan delivers the Resurrection prayer amid the cathedral's
    solemn glow, a grief-stricken President Bartlet stares vacantly ahead, emotionally
    detaching from the collective mourning of Abbey, Leo, and the staff. Overwhelmed

    insistent voiceover calling 'Jed!' twice. This pivot reveals his profound isolation,
    excavates their formative bond, and transitions from present anguish to revelatory

  title: Bartlet's Thousand-Yard Funeral Stare

    Landingham's funeral, President Bartlet sits transfixed, his thousand-yard stare

  title: Landingham Dismantles Jed's Excuses, Igniting His Equity Crusade
  description: In a pivotal flashback, young Mrs. Landingham confronts young Jed Bartlet
    outside school as he struggles with his car, wielding salary data to expose gender
    pay inequities. She systematically refutes his rationalizations—defending male
    colleagues' higher pay—challenging his privilege and fear. Positioning herself
    as his needed 'big sister,' she hails his untapped genius as a 'Boy King' and
    demands he confront his principal father. His subtle gesture—hands in pockets,
    averted smile—signals commitment, forging the moral backbone that echoes in adult
    Bartlet's defiant resolve amid grief and crisis.

  title: Bartlet's Blasphemous Rant Against God and Defiant Reelection Stand
  description: In the emptied National Cathedral post-Mrs. Landingham's funeral, Bartlet
    brushes off Leo's somber consolation and orders the doors sealed for solitude.
    Alone at the altar, grief erupts into a raw, Latin-infused tirade accusing God
    of vindictive cruelty—citing her death, Josh's shooting, lost sailors, and his
    MS lie—while touting achievements like jobs created and conservation. Grinding
    a cigarette defiantly into the floor, he rejects divine disfavor and bellows 'You
    get Hoynes!', spurning party pressure to yield reelection to VP Hoynes, forging
    a pivotal arc from despair to unyielding resolve amid personal and political crises.

    Toby's meeting with Greg Summerhays, who enters offering brief condolences for
    Mrs. Landingham's death. Cutting to the chase, Summerhays pitches Toby a job building

    it as premature vulturing amid the administration's crisis, sarcastically interrupts
    and storms out in fury, rejecting the 'lifeboat' outright. This beat crystallizes

  title: Bartlet's Storm-Fueled Cry and Spectral Reckoning with Landingham
  description: Amid thunderous storm chaos mirroring his turmoil, President Bartlet
    calls desperately for his late secretary Mrs. Landingham as wind blasts open the
    veranda door. Her resolute apparition enters, gently chiding his intercom ignorance
    before he confesses his hidden MS diagnosis. She dismisses his self-pity and divine
    rage over her death, counters his party woes by invoking his father's flaws, and
    propels a rapid-fire exchange of devastating U.S. social statistics—poverty, uninsured,
    homicide, incarceration, addiction—transforming grief into galvanized resolve.
    This hallucinatory turning point excavates Bartlet's vulnerability, reframes loss
    as moral imperative, and pivots him toward reelection defiance.

  title: Bartlet Snubs Altman, Playfully Draws Out Sandy's Reelection Query
  description: As Bartlet approaches the podium, C.J. whispers a reminder to call
    on front-row reporter Lawrence Altman, but the President deliberately bypasses
    him, pointing to Sandy in the center—a calculated snub asserting control over
    the narrative. Sandy poses the pivotal reelection question; Bartlet feigns hearing
    impairment, asking her to repeat it with sly playfulness. Staff watches tensely,
    Leo urging 'Watch this...', heightening anticipation for his defiant recommitment
    amid grief, MS secrecy, and party disloyalty. This turning point excavates Bartlet's
    rebellious spirit, transforming vulnerability into commanding presence.
