  title: Bartlet Mishears Tanker Brief as 'Michigan Sucks' Amid Engine Roar
  description: At Andrews Air Force Base, amid roaring jet engines, Leo briefs President
    Bartlet on stopping a Cyprus-flagged tanker from Qais suspected of carrying sanctioned
    oil, confirming plans to board it. Bartlet mishears 'Bruno and Hess' as 'Michigan
    sucks,' playfully linking to C.J.'s recent Notre Dame-Michigan joke. Leo humorously
    blames the noise and counters with a Notre Dame jab. This levity humanizes Bartlet's
    gravitas, offers comic relief in a high-stakes crisis, and plants seeds for aggressive
    sanctions enforcement.

    and orders a chocolate chip muffin, Fresca, and ice from the waiter, who informs

    pressures Josh with the bill's overwhelming bipartisan passage (85 Senate votes,

    bans and mocking conservatives' hypocrisy on small government invading bedrooms.

  title: Josh Dismantles Skinner's Biblical Defense of Marriage Bill

    Staff Josh confronts gay Republican Congressman Skinner over his discriminatory
    marriage bill. Josh sharply challenges Skinner's appeal to Judeo-Christian morality,
    invoking the founders' strict separation of church and state, and underscores
    the bill's devastating denial of federal benefits like survivor annuities, Medicare,
    and Medicaid to gay partners. Skinner deflects with fiscal pragmatism and pleas
    of exhaustion, but Josh presses relentlessly, revealing his moral fervor against
    discrimination and testing Skinner's conflicted loyalty in a microcosm of the
    administration's ethical battles amid crisis.

  title: Josh Interrogates Ainsley on Marriage Act's Legal Loophole
  description: Josh abruptly interrupts Ainsley's work (and Donna's lingering chat),
    demanding clarity on the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Ainsley crisply explains
    its mandate for states to honor other states' marriages—like Maryland to Nebraska—but
    reveals how the Marriage Recognition Act circumvents unconstitutionality by letting
    Congress define 'marriage' narrowly, targeting gay unions. This urgent consultation
    equips Josh with vital legal ammo amid his moral crusade against the bill, exposing
    the administration's constitutional bind and fueling his high-stakes strategizing.

  key_dialogue:
  - 'JOSH: "Talk to me about the Full Faith and Credit Clause."'
  - 'AINSLEY: "It says that full faith and credit shall be given by each state to
    the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other state - it means
    if you''re married in Maryland it''s got to be recognized by Nebraska."'
  - "JOSH: \"So, how is the Marriage Recognition Act not unconstitutional?\" \n AINSLEY:\
    \ \"Cause it also says that Congress can proscribe the manner in which such acts\
    \ and records are proved - which means they can decide what being married means\
    \ within the context of Article IV.\""

  title: Toby Overrides C.J. and Reclaims the Speech Draft
  description: C.J. delivers a confusing pre-landing briefing to reporters, hedging
    on potential education speech changes despite prior assurances, sparking groans.
    Toby swiftly intervenes, flatly denying any alterations to reassert Communications
    control. He then smoothly retrieves the draft from teasing reporter Danny, fabricating
    Sam's dissatisfaction to secure it effortlessly. This power play underscores Toby's
    vigilant guardianship of policy messaging amid airborne staff tensions, while
    Danny's banter with C.J. reveals playful press-staff rivalries rooted in college
    loyalties, diffusing tension with humor before landing.

    in the education speech tomorrow.'
  - 'TOBY: There isn''t going to be a change.'
  - 'TOBY: Danny, Sam choked hard on the last draft and wants to burn it. / DANNY:

  title: Bartlet Rejects Marriage Bill as 'Legislative Gay Bashing'
  description: In Leo's office aboard Air Force One at night, Josh presses forward
