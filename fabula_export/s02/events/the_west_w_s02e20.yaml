  title: Donna's Bullpen Greeting Interrupted by Satellite Prank Panic
  description: In Josh's chaotic bullpen, Donna professionally greets waiting Martin
    Connelly, multitasks weather checks amid staff bustle, then falls victim to Ed
    and Larry's prank fax from NASA about a massive Chinese satellite hurtling uncontrollably
    toward Earth. Her genuine terror erupts—'A satellite is gonna crush into the Earth?'—as
    they mockingly reveal it's for C.J., laughing off her panic. This farcical beat
    injects gallows humor and levity, thematically paralleling the administration's
    spiraling MS cover-up crisis as an impending, unpredictable catastrophe.

  title: Sam Refocuses SME Speech on Fundamentals Amid CBO Boost and Caucus Clash
  description: In the Roosevelt Room, Sam paces, reading his SME speech draft to aides
    and insisting on returning to tax cut fundamentals amid partisan debates, signaling
    his strategic refocus on core messaging. Interrupted, he learns from Jane Gentry
    and Richard Will of a favorable CBO surplus downgrade—less money eases the floor
    fight politically. Sam celebrates this pivot, but firmly rejects the Progressive
    Caucus's populist attack line as poor writing unfit for the President's voice,
    asserting narrative control. This governance beat contrasts the MS crisis, highlighting
    Sam's policy savvy and isolation from the inner secret.

    We need to get back to fundamentals.'

    for higher education and housing, while our opponents want to help the rich pay
    for bigger swimming pools and faster private jets. [pause] No, I don''t think
    so." JANE: "They want it in." SAM: "No, no, no... Well, tell them to do their

  title: Oliver Ruthlessly Grills C.J. on MS Collapse and Flu Lie
  description: In the White House Counsel's office, Oliver Babish launches a surgical
    interrogation of Press Secretary C.J. Cregg, probing her firsthand witness to
    President Bartlet's MS attack a year prior and her public flu announcement. C.J.
    deflects with sharp, evasive sarcasm—rambling about exotic diseases, historical
    presidential ailments, and cross-dressing stats—to shield her loyalty and avoid
    implicating superiors. Unfazed by her charm offensive, Oliver dismantles her tactics,
    demanding precision and halting the session amid her defiant outburst. This pivotal
    confrontation excavates C.J.'s complicity, heightening the cover-up's legal tensions
    and fracturing White House solidarity as subpoenas loom.

  title: Abbey's Brisk Return and Fiery MS Reckoning
  description: Abbey Bartlet emerges tensely from her limousine on the White House
    portico, exchanging clipped greetings and light banter with aides about her trip—christening
    a medevac helicopter—before striding purposefully to the Oval Office. Inside,
    she confronts President Bartlet about concealing his MS diagnosis, her fury peaking
    upon learning she unwittingly signed Zoey's Georgetown medical form to cover it
    up. Their raw exchange—marked by evasion, shouting, exhaustion, and resigned family
    chit-chat—lays bare the marital fracture and personal toll of the deception, priming
    her for Oliver Babish's ruthless interrogation and escalating the crisis's intimate
    stakes.

  title: Leo Confesses Zoey Slip to Abbey as Josh Presses Tobacco Funding Amid Crisis
  description: In a tense exchange at Margaret's desk transitioning to Leo's office,
    Josh probes Leo about First Lady Abbey's return, prompting Leo's guilty admission
    that he accidentally revealed Zoey's Harvard application issue—part of the MS
    cover-up—before President Bartlet could. Subtext reveals deepening Bartlet family
    fractures intersecting with White House strain. Pivoting abruptly, idealistic
    Josh urgently requests $30 million for the DOJ's tobacco suit against congressional
    opposition, but pragmatic Leo rebuffs him, dismissing the plea as politically
    doomed while tasking a report and sending Josh to the airport for covert MS polling.
    This beat revelation compounds personal crises, contrasts staff dynamics, and
    propels parallel plotlines forward.

      greeting Abbey, politely inquiring about her trip, then blurting satellite panic
      before peeling off, her urgency clashing obliviously with Abbey's hidden torment.
    observed_status: Donna pivots from plutonium shock into a brisk walk-and-talk,
      professionally greeting Abbey, politely inquiring about her trip, then blurting
      satellite panic before peeling off, her urgency clashing obliviously with Abbey's
      hidden torment.

    - The hurtling satellite demands immediate White House alarm

    description_of_involvement: Donna invokes the plutonium-armed Chinese satellite
      as a 'giant object hurtling its way towards us at devastating velocity,' channeling
      fresh plutonium terror into her plea to Abbey; it functions as oblivious staff
      panic trigger, ironically dwarfed by Abbey's unspoken MS cataclysm for savage
      thematic contrast.
    status_before_event: Decaying orbit, contents speculated as plutonium-laden, unreported
      by media
    status_after_event: Impending crash threat amplified in conversation, still hurtling
      unchecked
  - object_uuid: object_8cdcacd83829
    description_of_involvement: Abbey casually cites the MedEvac helicopter named
      after her as trip highlight, injecting fleeting honor and normalcy into her
      weary exchange with Donna; it underscores ironic poise amid crisis, a symbolic
      lift before her ironic crash-landing retort.
    status_before_event: Freshly christened during Abbey's trip, operational elsewhere
    status_after_event: Referenced as personal accolade, unchanged and distant

  title: Josh Confirms Covert Poll; Leo Reveals It to Reluctant Bartlet
  description: Josh briefs Leo that pollster Joey Lucas has agreed to a blind poll
    framing Bartlet's MS as a Michigan governor's undisclosed illness, securing Leo's
    cautious approval. Josh raises the Justice bill, citing AAG Connelly's fraud charge
    against Big Tobacco—a loaded parallel to their cover-up that Leo dismisses. Leo
    then faces Bartlet's ire for preempting his Abbey disclosure, reveals the poll
    despite Bartlet's fear it undermines his voluntary confession, and summons Sam,
    operationalizing crisis strategy while exposing deepening fractures.

  - 'JOSH: "She''s in." LEO: "What''s she going to do?" JOSH: "If the Governor of
    a major industrial state had a degenerative illness which he hadn''t disclosed
    during the election but which has yet to impair his job performance, would you
    still support him?" LEO: "Which one?" JOSH: "Michigan."'
  - 'JOSH: "...this Assistant A.G., Martin Connelly... said, ''They perpetrated a
    fraud against the public.''" LEO: "We''re not big tobacco."'
  - 'BARTLET: "Leo, how could you tell Abbey about the health form before I did?"
    [...] LEO: "We''re putting a poll in the field." BARTLET: "I''m coming clean,
    I''m doing it voluntarily. Anyone finds out, it''s going to look like I did it
    because a poll told me to." LEO: "Then it''d be a good idea if nobody found out."'
