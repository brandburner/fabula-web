  title: Josh Unmasks Surveillance Pretext in Therapy Clash
  description: 'Josh enters the secluded White House room for his mandated therapy
    session on Christmas Eve, meeting Dr. Stanley Keyworth and trainee Kaytha Trask.
    After brushing off a query about his bandaged hand and enduring Stanley''s ATVA
    credentials pitch, Josh erupts, flaunting his insider knowledge and accusing them
    of deception: Kaytha''s presence is a surveillance pretext, not mere training.
    Stanley admits it, agreeing to restart honestly—but immediately pivots back to
    the hand injury, silencing Josh. This revelation shatters the session''s facade,
    exposing Josh''s paranoia and frayed control amid PTSD, reclaiming his agency
    in a pivotal standoff that escalates vulnerability and sets up deeper trauma excavation.'

  title: Josh's Rosslyn Obsession and Detached Trauma Recount
  description: Stanley builds tentative rapport offering coffee, then pivots to Donna's
    role and probes the Rosslyn shooting, triggering Josh's compulsive name correction
    ('Rosslyn, not Rosalyn') and rote listing of companions from the event. Fracturing

    heard gunshots... woke up in hospital'—exposing his denial and buried PTSD. Stanley
    redirects to Josh's erratic behavior three weeks prior, linking to pilot fixation,
    heightening therapeutic tension and revealing risks to Josh's pivotal White House
    role as a turning point in confronting his unraveling.

  title: C.J. Masters Press Briefing on IMF, Tour Freakout, and SPR Shift
  description: In the Press Room, C.J. deftly fields queries on the IMF-World Bank
    Prague meeting, downplaying Pete Didian's objections amid congressional recess.
    She humorously deflects Mark's odd report of a woman screaming at a painting during
    a White House tour, blaming Dolly Madison's portrait. Katie probes the Energy
    Secretary's SPR comments; C.J., cued by Sam's nod, pivots policy nuance without
    commitment. Post-briefing huddle with Sam reveals routine tour 'crazies'; Josh
    praises her 'good save' en route to pilot crisis. This routine beat showcases
    C.J.'s command under scrutiny, bridging policy threads and underscoring White
    House normalcy amid Josh's unraveling.

  title: Josh Reveals President's Pilot Crisis to C.J.
  description: As C.J. concludes her press briefing and parts ways with Sam in the
    hallway, Josh intercepts her with a casual 'Good save,' praising her deft handling
    of the energy policy query. When she inquires about the President's whereabouts,
    Josh discloses he's in the Situation Room dealing with 'something about a pilot.'
    This terse exchange catapults Josh's personal obsession with the suicidal pilot—fueled
    by his PTSD—into a national security crisis, heightening tension on Christmas
    Eve and foreshadowing the collision of his unraveling psyche with White House

  title: Door Knock Triggers Josh's Vivid PTSD Flashback
  description: 'As Stanley relentlessly presses Josh on his assignment to investigate
    the suicidal pilot''s personal records, a sudden loud knock at the door jolts
    Josh, plunging him into a harrowing PTSD flashback: alone in his apartment, shirt
    disheveled, hand bleeding from the White House shooting trauma as knocking echoes.
    Stanley instantly grounds him—''It''s the coffee, Josh''—yanking him back to the
    present. This visceral interruption exposes Josh''s raw vulnerability, escalating
    the therapy''s stakes and revealing how everyday triggers fracture his high-functioning
    facade amid national crises.'

  title: Leo Delivers Pilot's Cryptic Final Words
  description: Interrupting Josh's solitary fixation on pilot photos, Leo enters to
    report the F-16's fatal crash into a Mexican mountain. Josh, gripped by obsession,
    presses for details, learning the pilot was alive and uttered the haunting words,
    'It wasn't the plane.' Unsettled yet evasive, Josh resumes studying photos as
    Leo probes deeper into his knowledge. Stanley's intrusive voice-over echoes Leo's
    question, 'What else?', blurring mentor inquiry with therapeutic pressure and
    amplifying Josh's PTSD-fueled unraveling amid the pilot parallel.

  title: Donna Grounds Josh's Caroler-Triggered Dissociation
  description: Emerging from White House gates on Christmas Eve, Josh defiantly rejects
    medical attention for his shooting-induced PTSD, but Donna sharply counters with
    logic, asserting control. Halting before singing carolers, Josh drifts into dissociation—his
    distant gaze merging festive harmonies with phantom sirens from his trauma. Donna
    intuitively detects the fracture, verbally anchors him back ('Josh?'), and physically
    leads him away toward help. This turning-point beat shatters Josh's denial, propels
    his healing arc, and elevates Donna's role as emotional sentinel amid holiday
    irony.
