  title: Bookshelf Spill Ignites Donna's Grateful Confession to Josh
  description: 'Donna enters Josh''s office as he precariously knocks books and binders
    from an overloaded shelf while hunting for Sam''s speech. Amid cleanup, she teases
    his technophobic old-school habits, then pivots to vulnerability: revealing her
    ''ice slip'' was a car accident, her ex-boyfriend callously stopping for beer
    post-hospital. She thanks Josh for rehiring her trustlessly, without mockery,
    affirming their profound, unspoken loyalty. Josh asserts he''d prioritize her;
    she retorts she''d ignore red lights for him, exiting with floral praise. This
    banter-to-intimacy beat humanizes their bond, setups deeper trauma revelation,
    and offers levity contrasting Oval Office MS crisis.'
