      title: The West Wing — In the Shadow of Two Gunmen Part I
      logline: After an assassination attempt leaves President Bartlet gravely wounded,
        his inner circle—Leo, Abbey, C.J., and senior staff—scramble to stabilize
        him, preserve continuity of government, and hunt the shooters before national
        chaos erupts.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Gunfire rips through a public appearance in Rosslyn and propels the West Wing into immediate, brutal motion. Minutes after the shots, limousines roar across the George Washington Bridge: Bartlet gasps blood into his hands, Ron Butterfield shows a bloody, bandaged palm, and Zoey vomits from shock in the car behind them. Ron orders the limo to swing around and drive the President to George Washington Hospital. Nurses and trauma teams pivot on a red phone; Dr. Keller calls for a crash cart and an ultrasound. Bartlet arrives with an entry-and-exit abdominal wound; Dr. Keller reassures him that an exit wound and stable vitals are promising even as Bartlet insists, half-joking, on speaking to Leo before anesthesia. Leo arrives, exchanges a brief, intimate kiss on Bartlet’s cheek, and braces to run the executive response.

        The hospital becomes a pressure cooker of medical triage and command decisions. Zoey whispers to her father while nurses fumble; Abbey presses for details. C.J. staggers through a chaotic press briefing, dazed and evasive when questioned about security procedures and the missing canopy used in previous administrations. On the scene, Gina Toscano reports, "Two shooters in that window...but there was a signal," confirming a coordinated attack; Tommy Cho demands perimeter closures and Coast Guard patrols. Airports and Union Station close, a massive manhunt for an alleged third accomplice ignites, and the AP claims two bodies were removed from the building.

        The wound profile sharpens the stakes: Josh Lyman, wounded at the event, arrives at Trauma One with a collapsed lung and a lacerated pulmonary artery. He fights consciousness, whispering "Senator..." and "I shouldn't be at this meeting," as surgeons and nurses work to re-expand his lung and repair the artery. The surgical team warns the staff that Josh’s procedure could take 12–14 hours. In the operating room, time stretches; Josh’s colleagues hover helplessly as monitors slip into slow motion and voices fragment into whispered, overlapping fragments about Social Security and the Senator's campaign—an evocative cut from crisis to memory.

        The Situation Room pivots to national security decisions even as the President lies under anesthesia. Leo and the Vice President, John Hoynes, chair a tense meeting with National Security Advisor Nancy McNally and military officers. Nancy presses vertically: KH-10 satellite images show a Republican Guard buildup and a recent shoot-down of an F-117—evidence, she argues, that a broader, possibly coordinated international threat exists. Leo urges restraint, quipping that the Iraqi Republican Guard "can't find their car keys in 36 hours," while Nancy warns "we may not have 36 hours." Hoynes threatens to federalize state National Guards and demands swift arrests of the signal man; Leo and Nancy spar over whether to raise DEFCON. Legal ambiguity compounds the operational crisis: without a signed letter or invocation of the 25th Amendment, the Vice President's authority during the President's anesthesia remains murky. Toby hunts down Section 202 of the National Security Act of 1947 and the counsel's office scrambles to define the chain of command.

        Personal immediacy punctures policy. Abbey, frantic and direct, asks about Josh; Dr. Keller reports the bullet "lacerated his pulmonary artery" and that primary repair is necessary. Bartlet, lucid enough to joke and order the cabinet and Security Council, asks Leo to suspend stock trading and calls for the Cabinet to assemble. In the recovery room, Bartlet pleads to see Josh; despite Abbey’s cautions, doctors allow a brief visit, underscoring the human toll beneath the constitutional and military maneuvers.

        Flashbacks to three years earlier stage the show's politics and relationships: Leo cajoles Josh to come to Nashua to hear Jed Bartlet speak; scenes in a Senate conference room and a VFW hall reveal the threads that bind the staff—ambition, loyalty, and ideological friction. These memories underscore what the present jeopardizes: careers, campaigns, and the fragile architecture of trust. Hoynes’ earlier campaign meeting with Josh (where Hoynes calls Social Security the "black hole of national politics") and Bartlet’s grassroots VFW exchanges show how present leadership emerged from ordinary political argument and personal persuasion—things now suddenly at risk.

        By episode’s end, the crisis achieves a tense, unresolved balance. The President is rushed into surgery and appears likely to survive; Bartlet is sedated but requests Leo speak to Abbey and the staff; Leo and the senior team juggle military posturing and legal ambiguity while the city and transportation hubs lock down. Josh lies in an operating room with surgeons fighting to repair a pulmonary artery; his fate hangs in the balance. C.J. fields agitated reporters about identity of shooters, the 25th Amendment, and security lapses while staffers—Sam, Toby, Donna, Charlie—rotate between prayer, procedural tasks, and stunned silence. The episode closes with Bartlet and Leo peering through the operating-room window at Josh’s surgery, the public and private crises braided together: the President’s survival, the Vice President’s authority, the search for conspirators, and the personal costs to a White House that must continue to govern even as its own heart bleeds.

        The script propels forward with clipped, urgent exchanges—Ron’s panicked commands, Gina’s terse field reports, Dr. Keller’s clinical calls, and Bartlet’s human cracks of humor—keeping the moral and constitutional dilemmas tethered to bodily reality. It ends on a taut, open question: medical machines blink and staff pray; the country braces, and the Bartlet team stands between triage and statecraft, uncertain which will demand more.

      title: In the Shadow of Two Gunmen Part 2
      logline: After an assassination attempt leaves Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman
        critically wounded, his colleagues race to stabilize the White House, shape
        the story, and reckon with procedural failures — risking political chaos,
        personal rupture, and national unease.
      high_level_summary: |-
        A gunshot fractures the night and the White House's fragile normalcy. The episode opens with a skinhead watching breaking news in a roadside diner — a swastika etched on his hand, a cigarette crushed in eggs — and then collapsing under the floodlights of police and Secret Service. Reporters announce that Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Lyman lies in surgery to repair a collapsed lung and a ruptured pulmonary artery; a bullet remains lodged in his thoracic region. That single violent event propels a pressure-cooker of crisis management, confessional flashbacks, and moral reckoning.

        The story alternates between frantic present-day response and formative flashbacks from the Bartlet campaign three years earlier, stitching together how people came together and what they sacrificed. In the White House briefing room, C.J. Cregg holds tightly to the 7:30 a.m. podium, parrying reporters as she releases the name of an injured bystander (Stephanie Abbott) while deflecting every probing question about the suspect. Her public poise belies private shakiness: she cannot remember who pulled her down during the shooting, only that her necklace came off. Sam Seaborn sits in the hospital waiting room with the senior staff; fear and procedural confusion ripple through the team as they await updates on Josh and the President.

        Officials capture a suspect — Carl Leroy — who implicates a group called West Virginia White Pride; two rooftop shooters used a 9mm Beretta and a .357 Desert Eagle, but the Secret Service's sharpshooters respond with specialized rifles (JARs). Ron Butterfield briefs the wounded President and his family; Charlie learns that the President may not have been the intended target, a revelation that momentarily disorients personal assumptions about motive. C.J. repeatedly returns to the podium to expand the record, pivoting from official ballistics to a wider indictment of gun violence — she lists names and statistics, driving the coverage away from rumor and toward context: dozens killed, hundreds assaulted. Her voice shapes the national frame.

        Behind the public choreography, constitutional and bureaucratic alarms blare. Leo and Margaret discover that no letter transferring power to the Vice President was signed before the President entered anesthesia — "we blew that play," Leo admits. Margaret, with disarming candor, jokes that she can sign the President's name, and the conversation skitters between gallows humor and the reality that power temporarily went unassigned. Toby Ziegler confronts the moral weight of procedure: he confesses he wrote a memo, signed by the President, asking to discontinue tented exits; the open-air exits the President prefers now feed the scrutiny of the press. Ron refuses to make procedure public; he and Toby spar over blame and responsibility while their hands and emotions still bear the night's damage.

        The episode layers intimate flashbacks that explain the people now scrambling: Sam arguing for safer tankers in a Midtown conference room, railing at cheap choices and environmental liability; Josh pacing in the rain outside a Manhattan pay phone, searching for law firm numbers and later appearing drenched and oddly prophetic at a client meeting; C.J.'s rocky transition from Beverly Hills PR — Roger Becker abuses her, Isobel fires her, and Leo/ Toby recruit her into a national campaign — scenes that demonstrate how these characters were forged by compromise, risk, and loyalty. We witness the origin of Donna Moss as Josh's indefatigable, overqualified assistant: she insists she can learn, she sells her car to follow the campaign, and quietly promises to be there. Those flashes bind the present trauma to past devotion.

        Emotional pressure mounts in small, consequential gestures. Sam returns C.J.'s necklace — an intimate, grounding exchange — and admits to his fear; C.J. admits she, too, was afraid. Leo instructs Danny to ride to the hospital with him; Toby presses Ron to release his memo to clear the Secret Service of blame. Ron refuses, insisting the attack was "an act of madmen," not an equipment or protocol failure. Margaret's offhand offer to forge the President's signature encapsulates how close the institution teeters between improvisation and constitutional crisis.

        The political apparatus strains but steadies. C.J. channels fury into a public moral argument about guns; Sam, C.J., Toby, Leo, and others absorb the practical tasks of who speaks, who signs, and who comforts. Charlie internalizes the revelation that Zoey and his relationship were not the motive; Bartlet, recovering, listens as Ron reports the weapons used and the casualty math. The team balances personal grief (Josh's severe injuries, the death of bystanders) with the imperative to maintain national calm.

        In the closing arc, the story collapses into a single, human moment: Josh lies under anesthesia, and the flashbacks to campaign victory and quiet mentorship — Bartlet's surprising presence at the airport, the poignancy of Josh's father dying on the night of an Illinois primary win — fold into the operating room. Leo, Bartlet, and doctors stand over him. Bartlet leans in and asks what Josh murmured when he woke. "What's next?" Bartlet repeats, a question that converts disorder into resolve. Josh opens his eyes. The episode alights on that word — forward — and dissolves into end titles.

        Throughout, the episode interrogates duty under fire: the staff's procedural missteps, the Secret Service's taciturn defense of practice, the team's willingness to improvise when institutions fail. The flashbacks provide a counterpoint of origin stories: ambition, sacrifice, and the small mercies that bind a governing team. The episode ends not with tidy answers but with a raw, forward-tilted energy — leadership damaged but not defeated, a wounded deputy asking, as Bartlet echoes, "What's next?"

      title: The Midterms
      logline: C.J. Cregg and President Bartlet's senior staff race to convert a post-assassination-attempt
        approval surge into midterm gains while battling moral dilemmas over exploiting
        tragedy, a tainted candidate, and the fate of the House.
      high_level_summary: |-
        A week after an assassination attempt propels President Bartlet's approval numbers skyward, the White House scrambles to turn sympathy into political advantage while confronting the ethical cost of doing so. The episode opens with Josh Lyman convalescing in a hospital bed—plugged into the staff's lives by speakerphone as C.J. Cregg fumbles a press gag about "The Theory of Everything"—and the administration riding a surreal 81% approval rating. Staffers convene in the Roosevelt Room, energized by polls and haunted by the shooting's aftermath, and immediately split over strategy: exploit the spike to win back the House or refrain from appearing to profit from national trauma.

        C.J. asserts restraint. Toby argues for aggression, urging the White House to use the moment to crack down on guns and hate groups; his fever builds into raw anger as he demands registration and disclosure for extremist organizations, punctuated by an outburst—"YES I DO!"—that exposes how close the stakes have come to personal obsession. Bartlet, alternately sardonic and paternal, worries less about electoral arithmetic and more about moral clarity; he repeatedly returns to the small, local contest that has lodged in his conscience—a school board race against Elliot Roush, a man Bartlet once beat and now polls dangerously high in. C.J. counsels against presidential intervention in a local race, warning it will galvanize opposition and undercut the broader goal of reclaiming the House.

        Parallel to the national calculus, the staff handles raw, intimate failures and loyalties. Sam Seaborn recruits Tom Jordan, a prosecutor with a compelling biography, to run for an open House seat left when Congressman Grant Samuels dies; Sam's pitch is muscular—"you'll have the full weight of the Democratic National Committee"—and he sells the campaign in five minutes. When Jordan's background surfaces—an all-white fraternity, jury-selection tactics that favor white jurors—racial leaders object and Leo McGarry moves to cut the White House's support. Sam refuses to abandon the man he recruited; the argument between Sam, Leo and Josh becomes a moral throat-punch: Sam sees desertion as betrayal, Leo sees politics as arithmetic, and Josh, recovering in his apartment, tries to broker a strategic view while still dealing with trauma.

        Toby constructs a legalistic path to target extremist organizations by framing the shooting as the act of "at least three card-carrying members of West Virginia White Pride," a rhetorical maneuver meant to justify a broad federal response without immediate judicial cover. Bartlet calls the shooting what it feels like to him: "a lynching," and he presses the Attorney General to act, handing Toby keyhole satellite photos of the group's diner headquarters as proof. The moral urgency and legal uncertainty ripple through the staff: Donna enforces rules around Josh's recovery; C.J. refuses media pieces about the staff's psychological aftermath; Charlie navigates personal grief and intimacy—he and Zoey Bartlet briefly explore life beyond the White House—and technical support Andrew Mackintosh and his son Jeffrey bring tender, grounding moments to the Oval Office corridors.

        The President alternates private obsession and public restraint. He broods over Elliot Roush, recounting cookie-bake sales and the small-town politics that seed national movements. He attends a Talk Radio reception to meet polarizing media figures and squares off with Dr. Jenna Jacobs over scripture and public speech, trading barbs that expose both political theater and moral conviction: Bartlet's sardonic litany of biblical injunctions forces the crowd to confront context and hypocrisy. The episode threads sharp satire with high stakes as the staff tries to keep ethical lines intact while playing for narrow, brutal wins.

        On Election Night, tension resolves into a bitterly ironic result: twelve races come down to the wire and in none does the incumbent party retain control in those contests; the flips split seven to five in favor of the opposition, leaving the House effectively unchanged. Tom Jordan loses decisively—"probably 58-42"—and the Jordans angrily note the absence of White House support. Sam absorbs the loss and the sense of betrayal; Leo, pragmatic and exhausted, defends the budgetary and political calculus that forced withdrawal. The episode closes with the staff gathered on a stoop, exhausted and rueful, clinking beer bottles and intoning "God bless America." The line lands as both a benediction and a question.

        The Midterms tightens the screws on conscience versus calculation. It propels characters through moral contagion: Toby's righteous fury threatens civil liberties even as it seeks justice; Sam's loyalty courts dishonor in service of political wins; Bartlet's personal fixation on a small-town schoolboard tests presidential restraint; C.J. keeps the narrative together, fumbling jokes and steering the press away from exploitation. Through sharp dialogue—C.J.'s flub over "physicists" and "psychics," Bartlet's biblical mockery, and the searing declaration that the shooting "was a lynching"—the episode dramatizes how trauma reshapes strategy, how local fights feed national contests, and how political institutions strain under the weight of their own principles. The finale refuses tidy redemption: the House survives, reputations fray, and the staff returns to work, bruised but still in motion.

      title: In This White House
      logline: President Bartlet and his senior staff race to secure affordable AIDS
        drugs for African nations while courting sharp conservative Ainsley Hayes
        for the White House; negotiations fracture as a military coup imperils an
        allied president and risks lives.
      high_level_summary: |-
        A television punditry moment detonates into a moral and political test for the Bartlet administration. The episode opens with Ainsley Hayes — a bright, poised Republican making her TV debut on Capital Beat — shredding Sam Seaborn on live television. She punctures his talking points with precise facts and a cold insistence on accuracy — even calling opponents "flat-out lying" about textbooks — and the President, who has been watching, catches fire with the idea of bringing her into the White House.

        The narrative immediately crosscuts that domestic spark with a global crisis: the White House hosts a summit to wrestle with the AIDS catastrophe in Africa, and President Nimbala of the Republic of Equatorial Kuhndu arrives to plead for help. Staffers and corporate spokesmen collide over prices, patents, and practicalities. Sam, Josh, Toby and C.J. careen through competing pressures: moral urgency to get drugs to millions; pharmaceutical defenses about marginal costs, taxes and mark-ups; and hard diplomatic leverage that requires commitments from fragile governments. Alan, the pharmaceutical representative, insists his company gives away millions in drugs and that international distribution problems complicate any price story. Josh and Toby counter with blunt human math — pills cost a fortune compared to local incomes; some nations simply cannot shoulder those prices.

        Leo seizes the Ainsley moment and offers her a job as Associate White House Counsel. Ainsley responds with skepticism and rage; she refuses the tokenism of being the administration's Republican face, accuses the staff of smugness and patronizing condescension toward dissent, and demands real purpose rather than a ceremonial role. In a cold, electric meeting with Leo she lays out that she finds it wrong for officials to punish dissent, and that she has long been a Republican with civic duty — which unsettles the team and deepens the episode's exploration of ideological diversity inside an administration that values argument.

        Ainsley proves her mettle in another register when she quietly advises C.J.: invoking Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, she warns that confirming a grand jury can be a prosecutable offense. The exchange spotlights Ainsley’s legal competence and flips the staff’s assumptions about her; she becomes not a foil but a professional who insists on process and on the rule of law.

        At the summit, practical hurdles pile up into moral dilemmas. Josh and Toby negotiate a hard bargain with President Nimbala: in exchange for debt relief, loans and political cover, his government must crack down on the black market trade in counterfeit or illicitly imported HIV drugs. The U.S. team ties assistance to cooperation on customs, military and health enforcement — a deal meant to be pragmatic, not punitive. The technical realities intrude with painful clarity: complex dosing regimens, monitoring, and even the lack of wristwatches to time pills, all undercut simple narratives of "just give them the drugs." Toby and Josh argue that without systems to ensure drugs reach the right people at the right time, free drugs will not stem the epidemic.

        The moral abstractions collapse into tragedy when a coup erupts in Nimbala's country. The AFRC seizes the capital, the airport closes, and intelligence suggests Nimbala’s family is dead. Bartlet offers asylum, then faces the brutal limit of options: he cannot immediately deploy U.S. military assistance to save civilians or restore order without grave risk. The Oval Office becomes a pressure chamber of grief, responsibility and impotence. Nimbala, pleading and proud, confronts the humiliation of asking for help to save his people and his family. Bartlet and his team must manage evacuation, diplomatic fallout, and the human cost of policy choices.

        Throughout the episode, personal politics and public policy interlock. Ainsley, who had mocked the staff’s assumptions, ends the episode in a raw reconciliation with her own contradictions: she derides the smugness of some White House staffers but then, tearful, asserts "I'm their lawyer," acknowledging a deeper loyalty to the work’s civic purpose. Sam, Josh, Toby and C.J. show exhaustion and moral impatience, revealing how high-minded debates about patents, patents' economics and congressional politics play out against people literally dying.

        The episode closes on a somber note: Bartlet learns that Nimbala may have been executed, and the administration is left to carry the weight of a failed prevention and the consequences of limited leverage. The hire-that-could-have-been — Ainsley — remains a complicated symbol of the President’s desire to expand the tent and to insist on competence and argument; the summit’s failure and the coup’s human toll expose the hazards of moral clarity colliding with messy geopolitics. The work of governance, the episode insists, moves in the breathless space between ideal and feasible, where duty, strategy and human cost intersect.

      title: And It's Surely To Their Credit
      logline: In the frenetic West Wing, new Republican lawyer Ainsley Hayes battles
        staff skepticism and hazing while proving her mettle on a Capitol Hill crisis,
        as Bartlet flubs radio addresses amid Abbey's teasing delays, CJ skewers a
        rogue general, and Josh weighs suing the KKK over his shooting scars.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Chaos erupts in the White House bullpen as Josh Lyman bursts from his office, bellowing for Donna amid fresh torment from insurers demanding $50,000 for his near-fatal shooting recovery. Sam brushes it off with dark humor, but the wound festers—out-of-network bills stack like indictments. Donna herds radio address guests, her blacksmith quip bombs, yet Bartlet strides in, charming them instantly before mangling 'leaf peeping' into laughter, launching a marathon of 17 botched takes haunted by Lionel Tribbey's bat-swinging fury.

        Toby corners CJ, her nose unbent over Ainsley Hayes' hiring unlike the boys' club seething at the blonde Republican bombshell. But Ed Barrie, Army Chief of Staff, looms larger—a retiring three-star primed to savage readiness on Meet the Press. CJ dispatches Carol to drag him in; he sends a lieutenant instead. She brands it 'Ring and Run' cowardice, dispatching the aide with a gut punch.

        Leo cons Ainsley into euphoria over Tribbey's delight at her hire—then Tribbey explodes into Leo's office, cricket bat aloft, raging over staffers Steve Joyce and Mark Brookline's Rockland memo fumble before Congress. Spotting Ainsley, he dubs her idiot, fascist, alphabet-ignorant, but the President decrees her Counsel's office slot. Tribbey howls hysterically before storming Bartlet's taping, guests gaping as he reins in just enough for a sheepish exit.

        Bartlet, punchy from retakes, craves Abbey after 14 weeks' drought—her medical all-clear relayed via flustered Charlie sparks frantic Oval Office fumbling. 'New Hampshire's too far!' he gripes, but plutonium talks and Pennsylvania statue gigs delay bliss. Abbey teases with Nellie Bly lore, goading him into a radio pivot.

        Sam urges Josh to weaponize civil suit via Southern Poverty Law Center—subpoena Klan rolls, depose lone wolves tied to his shooters via maps, hate tapes, Hunter novels. Toby balks at deposition perils exposing staff vices, but pledges backup. Josh hesitates: too small, too personal for his public grind.

        Deep in Steam Pipe Trunk Distribution Venue—basement bat cave—Leo installs shell-shocked Ainsley. Tribbey tests her: 'Join the Navy?' She invokes duty; he mocks Gilbert & Sullivan. Yet he dispatches her to Hill, where she smooths Joyce/Brookline's mess, urging apologetic notes to GOP. They sneer; Sam, spotting dead-flower 'bitch' hazing, erupts—sweeps desks, scrawls firings. Tribbey backs him: 'Write your book now.'

        CJ corners Barrie at night—he boasts Hue, Grenada grit, but she unmasks his stolen Distinguished Combat Service Medal from desk-job USS Brooke. Deflated, he slinks out. Bartlet greenlights his vent: war vet's earned it.

        Time crunches: kids coach Bartlet's 21st take—he blurts 'Good evening!' at 5:45pm. Abbey's women's history torrent—Belva Lockwood, Ellen Richards—inspires triumph: monuments for overlooked heroines, Congress pledge seals it live.

        Josh nixes Klan suit—insurance blood next. Ainsley gropes basement darkness; lights blaze on Savoy posters, staff erupts in 'He is an Englishman!'—Pinafore salute, coffee toasts. She beams, partisanship yields to foxhole camaraderie. Duty credits them all, surely.

      logline: President Bartlet's staff battles to convene a lame duck Senate session
        for Test Ban Treaty ratification before incoming Senator Mitchell blocks it,
        confronting vote defections, diplomatic chaos from a drunken Ukrainian reformer,
        and internal White House rebellions amid ethical quandaries and ticking deadlines.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Chaos erupts in the West Wing as Press Secretary C.J. Cregg parries reporters' jabs in the briefing room, dodging questions about Vasily Konanov's shadowy visit and freshman Senator-elect Morgan Mitchell's vow to torpedo the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on the Foreign Relations Committee. Josh Lyman watches, smirking at her trap, then storms into the fray with Donna Moss, who yanks his ear over OSHA's ergonomics push for carpal tunnel prevention—six hundred thousand sufferers annually demand action, but Josh dismisses it amid higher stakes. The staff converges: Sam Seaborn urges a lame duck session, mapping a Senate domino chain—Casey grabs Appropriations, Taglio Budget, Newberry Armed Services, Weston Judiciary, freeing Foreign Relations for Mitchell. Toby Ziegler hammers the constitutional 'extraordinary circumstances': nuclear annihilation trumps politics. C.J. balks at optics—twelve defeated Senators job-hunting—but Toby insists it's pure politics.

        In the Oval Office, President Jed Bartlet endures the cacophony like Barnum & Bailey's circus, Leo McGarry wrangling them into coherence. They pitch: better odds now than post-election. Counterarguments fly—loss scars the agenda, angers the Senate—but Toby leaks the rumor, Toby and Sam hit the Hill for nose counts. Leo clamps down: two-page summaries only, no Oval free-for-alls after a scorching Post editorial likens the West Wing to a yearbook office. C.J. spars with Danny Concannon, leaking strategically while fuming over editorials; Donna rallies assistants to type slower in protest.

        Konanov's limo squats drunkenly in the driveway, refusing exit sans Presidential parley. Josh corrals the reformer into Toby's office, then his own, where Konanov rages at 'errand boys.' Leo greenlights an 'accidental' drop-in, à la Dalai Lama ploy: Donna Moss, empowered beard, lectures on keyboard ulnar deviation until Bartlet bursts in, feigning surprise, boots the escort, dresses down Konanov on WTO tariffs and nukes, then grants the photo-op brag. Mission accomplished, Konanov beams.

        Sam drags Republican Ainsley Hayes to Hill meetings, dangling reservations; she skewers staffers as schmucks chasing White House scalps, snags a muffin. Back home, she flips Sam's small-business fraud memo—85% steal given opportunity—convincing him, then Leo, in a whirlwind pitch. Toby lunches with Fox and Fowler, their fussy risotto masking betrayal: backyard defector. Desperate, Toby woos lame-duck Senator Tony Marino in a bar; shock—it's Marino abstaining, honoring voters who ousted him over the treaty, refusing to defy their verdict despite 82% national support.

        C.J. pitches Bartlet on denying Danny Oval access amid Post barbs; Bartlet demurs—petty, and Danny's no editorialist—plus whispers of Danny's job offer stir her jealousy. Bartlet blasts the Post but grants access, canceling only personal subscriptions. Night falls: Toby rants nuclear peril to tourists, Bartlet invokes Burke and republics over democracies—experts decide, not polls. No session called; window slams shut. Bartlet lures Toby to chess, day ends in resilient camaraderie. Subplots resolve—'rogue nations' soften to 'states of concern,' fraud prevention advances—yet lame-duck ethics prevail, staff chastened, democracy's messy judgment revered over raw power grabs.

        Sirens scream across Andrews Air Force Base as limousines surge toward Air Force One, President Jed Bartlet bundled inside with young Charlie Young, grilling him on the bizarre midnight rendezvous with Assistant Energy Secretary Gerald Wegland. The night pulses with urgency: a Cyprus-flagged tanker, slinking from Iraqi smugglers' haven Qais, defies UN sanctions in the Gulf. Leo McGarry briefs Bartlet amid roaring engines—board the ship, test the oil, fine the company. But profits dwarf penalties, sanctions toothless as a whisper.

        Press bus erupts in giggles as C.J. Cregg, Press Secretary exiled for mocking Notre Dame—rival to tomorrow's Michigan foe—announces her reluctant trip, donning a Fighting Irish cap under Bartlet's gleeful orders. She waves sheepishly from the plane stairs, hat perched like a crown of thorns, Bartlet bellowing, 'Let's hit the sky!' Main titles smash.

        Back in the White House, Josh Lyman spars with Donna Moss, her stunning red dress—borrowed, destined for return—signaling a rare date with 'great guy' Todd. Josh sabotages ruthlessly: 'You have terrible taste in men.' She storms off, dubbing him 'Deputy Downer.' Leo, divorce papers scorching his desk, fields Josh's worries over Bartlet's fatigue from the long haul.

        Aloft at 38,000 feet, Sam Seaborn clutches a mangled education speech draft, writer's block strangling his fire. Toby Ziegler demands revisions, but C.J. reveals premature distribution to press. Panic ignites: 'Get it back!' Sam's prose embarrasses, 'fingerprints all over it.' Bartlet corners C.J. on the tanker—'Make sanctions stick.' She clutches Notre Dame fight song lyrics, fist balled in futile rebellion: 'Go Irish!'

        Situation Room crackles: Sudanese captain repels Navy boarders with Kalashnikovs, freight barricades deck. F-18s buzz, warnings crack the night. Leo sighs, 'No way this ends well.'

        Ainsley Hayes sweats in her steam-baked office, fan whirring, craving Fresca. Josh meets Congressman Matt Skinner, sharp-suited gay Republican pushing the Marriage Recognition Act—federal shield defining marriage man-woman, states untouched. Ugly floor rhetoric scars: homosexuality likened to kleptomania. Skinner smiles: 'Yes, I am.' Josh reels, arguments flying—public polls, 14th Amendment, Full Faith and Credit. 'It's gay bashing!'

        Airborne, Sam and Toby rewrite: oratory must 'blow doors off,' echo Mao's 'permanent revolution'—Toby balks at Communist flair. Bartlet fuels the frenzy: late flights liberate impractical dreams. Charlie scribbles 'send them to college,' sparking tuition incentives for teaching stints in needy schools. '100,000 new teachers!' Toby resists: no funding, union backlash, kids abandoned post-three years. Bartlet pushes: 'Kick it around.'

        Donna's date flops—whiskey sours, soup at Phoebe's—lobbyist full of hot air. She consoles Ainsley, probing constitutional notes, hair dye fantasies masking insecurity. Leo dodges Margaret's alcoholic relapse fears, divorce raw.

        Tanker boarded, logs dumped overboard. Leo demands Air Force One return. C.J. wrestles press over speech drafts; Danny Concannon toys with her, Michigan loyalty stinging her Notre Dame slight. Toby retrieves it: 'Sam choked hard.'

        Josh grills Skinner: 'How can you stay in this party?' Skinner retorts—join NRA to flip it—95% platform alignment trumps sexuality. Escorts clap his shoulder lingeringly; Josh watches, conflicted. Toby phones: Josh urges signing the bill? No—pocket veto.

        Descent to Portland: C.J. flip-flops to press—possible education shift, then Toby quashes. Bartlet on phone: confiscate cargo, sell oil, fund anti-smuggling. Leo hedges. Josh pitches veto as symbolic stand, pivot to ENDA. Bartlet erupts: 'It's wrong. We shouldn't define love.' Drawer it goes.

        Leo rejects coffee with Josh, homeward bound. Margaret's worry softens: 'You're a good girl.' Bartlet to C.J.: Notre Dame tempted priesthood, Abbey derailed. Final speech lands: pilot program, 100 teachers—not 100,000. Tanker profits mock sanctions; marriage act looms. Wheels screech down Bonneville-3. A start, amid frustrations. Fade to black.

      logline: President Bartlet confronts a shipload of Chinese evangelicals fleeing
        persecution, testing one's faith with a biblical password to grant asylum
        amid INS skepticism, Chinese demands for repatriation, and Christian outrage,
        balancing mercy against diplomatic fury.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Chaos erupts at San Diego harbor as Coast Guard cutters snare the Horizon, a rusting container ship vomiting 83 gaunt Chinese stowaways from Fujian—13 corpses stiff in the hold, survivors gasping tales of crushed crosses and midnight raids. Josh Lyman bolts into the White House frenzy, briefing Leo McGarry as Thanksgiving absurdities collide: turkeys Eric and Troy gobble in C.J. Cregg's office, demanding her photogenic judgment for presidential pardon, while Sam Seaborn pitches 'Pilgrim Detectives' to Toby Ziegler, who snarls for focus on proclamations laced with liberty's fire.

        Refugees shatter protocols, claiming evangelical asylum. Josh and Sam grill Reverend Al Caldwell and firebrand Mary Marsh in the Roosevelt Room—faith's defenders hurl scripture like grenades, vowing bonds to free the flock, but Sam skewers their selective outrage over a gay Jesus play. INS agents Bertram and Gardner counter: $40,000 snakehead fees birth sweatshop slaves, coached piety a smugglers' sham. Toby ignites recess appointment wars, shoving Leo's sister, Dr. Josephine McGarry—Ph.D. firebrand against school prayer—onto the list to bait a national brawl. Republicans ambush with a damning photo: Josey at a high school game, cops cuffing praying band kids on their knees, nightstick looming, her tip to the shutterbug exposed.

        Leo erupts, yanking Josey into his office; she signs withdrawal, unbowed but broken by fratricide. 'We don't strut enforcing laws,' he thunders, eyes steel. Toby presses: spotlight the fourth-grader bullied for skipping prayer, expose division's venom. C.J. wrestles flapping fowl, Donna drilling 'We Gather Together' as Rose Garden kids loom, her sarcasm fraying under turkey triage.

        Bartlet summons chemistry professor Jhin-Wei to the Oval, sandwiches steaming untouched. 'Name Jesus' disciples,' he probes, then unleashes the shibboleth: faith's unfeigned proof. Jhin-Wei reels them off—Peter to James—crowning, 'Faith alone justifies,' echoing Paul's thunder. Shibboleth seals it; true believers. Leo warns of Beijing's ire—747 sales, Tibet talks teetering—but Bartlet maneuvers shadows. He orders California Governor to slacken the 22nd National Guard at Otay Mesa; starving faithful overpower sentries in a desperate dash, Red Cross swooping as China saves face: 'Yankee might crumbled!'

        Thanksgiving dawns electric. Bartlet gifts Charlie a Paul Revere heirloom knife—'My father to me, now you'—pride swelling as C.J. drags him to double-pardon Troy, schooling farmboy Morton: 'No judicial bird mercy; demand better schools!' Rose Garden beckons, kids' voices soaring 'He chastens and hastens His will,' Bartlet beaming: 'We've stormed the New World.' Proclamation rolls—pilgrims' liberty unbound—as refugees vanish into sanctuary's embrace. Faith triumphs law's cold blade; mercy mocks borders. Staff scatters to pizza and pigskin, bonds forged in crisis' forge, America's promise pulsing defiant.

      logline: President Bartlet rallies his team to inspire schoolchildren with NASA's
        Galileo V Mars probe landing, but a signal blackout, a concealed Russian missile
        silo explosion, and petty scandals threaten his vision of bold exploration
        amid political peril.
      high_level_summary: |-
        President Jed Bartlet strides down the White House colonnade, igniting C.J. Cregg's imagination with the mythic ring of 'Galileo V,' NASA's unmanned probe hurtling toward Mars. Adventure pulses in his veins as he rehearses a live classroom briefing for 60,000 students, flanked by NASA experts, eyes glued to beamed-back images from the red planet's surface. Bartlet's pulse quickens—he craves this chance to fire young minds with wonder, echoing Galileo Galilei's defiance of ancient dogma. But cracks spiderweb across the triumph.

        In the Mess, Josh Lyman and Toby Ziegler dissect Martian time zones over coffee, only for Leo McGarry to dump the Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee's push for Marcus Aquino, Puerto Rico's Korean War hero and statehood firebrand. Neutrality demands rejection, sparking Donna Moss's fiery defense of Puerto Rican rights amid colonial echoes. Toby sniffs out a Milwaukee Journal leak: an unnamed White House source claims Bartlet hates green beans. C.J. dismisses it—until Oregon's bean belt erupts, their razor-thin electoral win now imperiled.

        Bartlet clears his evening for Mars tomes, but Leo enforces penance: the Reykjavik Symphony at Kennedy Center to soothe Iceland's whale-hunting snub. Intelligence crashes in—smoke rises not from a Kozelsk oil refinery, but an SS-19 missile silo. Russians deny, clinging to Cold War shadows as Bartlet fumes over their decay: unpaid troops, faulty radars mistaking geese for Tridents, deserters siphoning hydrogen to hawk warheads.

        Galileo plummets into blackout eleven minutes pre-landing, probes silent after slamming subsurface for water traces. Toby urges cancellation of the classroom; Bartlet clings to hope, summoning Sam Seaborn and C.J. to the concert for a 'broader theme'—exploration's unyielding human drive. Sam dodges Mallory O'Brien, her fury over his call-girl photo still scorching, while C.J. fends off spurned State Department suitors like Tad Whitney amid her vegetable vortex.

        At Kennedy Center, modern music grates Bartlet's soul until an Icelandic composer's fourth movement unleashes genius, mirroring Galileo's pendulum swing. Leo corners Ambassador Nadia Kozlowski; Bartlet storms in, nerves raw, demanding NATO inspectors pierce Russian paranoia. Back in the Oval, crises converge: C.J. outs Charlie Young as the bean-blabbing culprit, Josh yields on the stamp, green beans morph into photo-op fodder.

        Galileo lingers lost, possibly safe-moded or antenna-tilted. Yet C.J. crystallizes the theme for Bartlet: tell kids failure demands the blackboard anyway—summon NASA’s best for Galileo VI. Armor cracks; vulnerability gleams. Bartlet gazes skyward under the colonnade, cigar aglow, whispering to the void: 'Talk to us.' Exploration endures, defiance intact, as stars mock earthly squabbles and propel humanity onward.

      logline: Deputy Chief of Staff Josh Lyman clashes with a surprise therapist
        on Christmas Eve, unearthing buried PTSD from a White House shooting that
        fractures his composure, fixates him on a suicidal pilot, and risks unraveling
        his vital role in the Bartlet administration.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Josh Lyman barrels through double doors into a dimly lit White House room on Christmas Eve, bandaged hand throbbing, confronting Dr. Stanley Keyworth and trainee Kaytha Trask. Defiance crackles immediately—Josh skewers their cover story, exposes the surveillance shadowing his every move, demands truth. Stanley counters with unflinching precision, zeroing in on the cut hand, the lies Josh peddles about a shattered glass. Flashbacks erupt, dragging us into the chaos brewing since the Rosslyn shooting months prior.

        Three weeks back, a rogue F-16 pilot, Robert Cano, breaks formation, armed and unresponsive, hurtling toward catastrophe. Josh dives into Cano's file—same birthday, Purple Heart from a fiery ejection over Bosnia, echoes of trauma Josh buries deep. The plane slams into a Mexican mountain; Cano's final words haunt: 'It wasn't the plane.' Irritability surges: Josh snaps at Toby's brass quintet blaring 'Joy to the World,' drowns in lobby cacophony mistaking music for sirens. Toby's bagpipers five days later shred his nerves; he screams for silence, slams doors, baffles colleagues.

        Toby floods the halls with holiday cheer—banjo brigades, Scottish regiments—each blast triggering phantom gunshots. C.J. probes a tour meltdown tied to a cursed painting; Sam pushes SPR policy shifts Josh resists. Paranoia grips: Josh hounds C.J. for Cano intel, mocks her acceptance of suicide. Climax detonates in the Oval Office—Sam's SPR pitch ignites Josh's fury. He lunges at Bartlet, wild gestures flying: 'You can't send Christmas cards to everyone! Listen to me!' Collapses policy rants into raw pleas, breathing ragged, eyes wild. Leo hauls him out, summons ATVA.

        Present therapy intensifies. Stanley dismantles defenses: Donna's Yo-Yo Ma obsession grates like nails; Oval meltdown exposed. Flash to the Congressional Christmas gala—white tie splendor, Bartlet touting Bach. Yo-Yo Ma unleashes the Suite in G Major; adrenaline floods Josh's mouth, bitter and metallic. Gunshots overlay cello strains, Rosslyn relived in screams, bullets, hospital haze. He bolts home, flashbacks pulverizing—smashes fist through window, blood pooling as superintendent pounds the door.

        Breakthrough shatters denial. Stanley names it: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, triggered by music morphing into sirens. No cure in hours, but unraveling begins—Josh admits the window, the reliving, the suicidal pilot's shadow. Stanley exits with a nod: 'We get better.' Leo waits in the lobby, spins the hole parable—friend jumps in, knows the way out. Loyalty anchors: 'As long as I got a job, you got a job.' Donna drags Josh to ER amid carolers' bells bleeding into sirens. Healing flickers amid White House frenzy, trauma's grip loosening in bonds of unyielding friendship, one raw confession at a time.

        debate on minimum wage and Patients' Bill of Rights at a leadership breakfast,
        igniting a brutal ambush by Republican chief Ann Stark that shatters fragile
        cooperation and ignites White House re-election fires.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Midnight shadows cloak the White House as Josh, Sam, and Donna wrestle damp spruce logs into the Mural Room fireplace, desperate for warmth amid biting January cold. Smoke billows, alarms shriek, yanking President Bartlet onto the Truman Balcony in his underwear—inciting fury that ripples through staff nerves already frayed by tomorrow's bipartisan Leadership Breakfast. Toby brandishes ironclad 'rules' dictating 90 minutes of pancake symbolism: no minimum wage hikes, no litigation clauses in the Patients' Bill of Rights (rechristened Comprehensive Access and Responsibility Act), just handshakes and tax relief euphemisms. Leo thunders restraint, but Toby chafes, haunted by marital ghosts of avoided truths.

        Dawn cracks open Oval Office skirmishes. Bartlet skewers Vermont maple syrup as treason against New Hampshire, while Leo dispatches Josh—then Sam—to Ben and Sally's dinner for groveling apologies to New York Times columnist Karen Cahill over a shoe slight. Cahill's siren pull unravels Sam into Kyrgyzstan nuclear blunders (Kazakhstan's arsenal, idiot), sparking Donna's underwear debacle at a South Street exhibit. CJ clashes with Ann Stark's aides in the Roosevelt Room, barricading press logistics: no Hill podiums eclipsing White House gravitas, no Republican spin stealing bipartisan thunder.

        Toby corners Ann over White House Mess eggs, her New Hampshire syrup gift a barbed pleasantry masking steel. He demands minimum wage talk—$5.15/hour trapping workers $2,600 below poverty—yielding 15 minutes on litigation only for Hill press dominance. Ann smirks, sensing weakness. Sam pitches OMB-fueled Press Room exile across the street (no swimming pool, just space), igniting CJ's veto as exile signaling secrecy; leaked DNC poll questions boomerang via reporters.

        Wednesday erupts on Capitol steps. Ann yanks sore-throated Majority Leader, unleashing surrogates who detonate Toby's leaked ultimatum: votes locked, amendments on everything. Spitballs fly, ambushes claimed, White House painted duplicitous. Toby reels, betrayed; CJ pivots to Briefing Room retaliation. Staff huddles in Leo's outer sanctum—high road crumbles under Josh's zinger: Leader's sore throat mocks uninsured woes.

        CJ storms the podium, smacks down 'bizarre' GOP hysterics, spotlights health care voting hypocrisy. Toby invades Ann's lair: no more bourbon ghosts, her wartime consigliere promotion signals Majority Leader's presidential shadow. Oval twilight: Bartlet scoffs Donna's panty plea via Charlie, Leo shields him from Kyrgyzstan quicksand. Toby confesses CJ-listen lapse; Leo invokes founders' party dread—divisiveness demands statesmanship, not theater. 'They're coming for us now,' Toby warns. Leo grips his hand: Committee to Reelect the President forms in shadowed pact, pancakes charred to ash, bipartisanship's veil torn asunder.

      logline: President Bartlet and his razor-sharp staff juggle a catastrophically
        failed missile defense test, the chaotic arrival of eccentric British ambassador
        Lord Marbury, and a high-stakes environmental speech laced with a surprise
        rebuke of eco-terrorism, testing alliances and igniting White House fury.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Explosions echo through the Situation Room as Leo drags a skeptical President Bartlet to witness the National Missile Defense test—a kill vehicle hurtling 137 miles off-target into the void of space. Bartlet savors the failure like a bitter punchline, dubbing Leo the eternal Charlie Brown to the Pentagon's Lucy, while upstairs he formally anoints Thailand's Ambassador Sumatra amid light banter about golf and James Michener typewriters. Tension crackles immediately: the test's flop underscores America's defensive vulnerabilities, pitting Leo's unyielding optimism against Bartlet's pragmatic doubt.

        Cut to the briefing room frenzy. CJ dazzles reporters with diplomatic trivia—Burkina Faso's crops, Saudi Arabia's dean—while masking the scramble over Britain's ambassador slot, careening from Anthony Brass's withdrawal to Sir Christopher Nealingroach's encephalitis, landing on the loathed Lord John Marbury. Toby storms back from Kansas City, livid at Sam's solo pitch for Bartlet to keynote the Global Defense Council (GDC), launching the Clean Air Rehabilitation Effort (CARE) without his input. 'He's nobody's understudy!' Toby thunders, but Sam counters with presidential enthusiasm. Toby pivots, demanding a 'drop-in'—a surgical strike in the speech slamming GDC silence on eco-terrorists torching a $12 million Colorado ski resort to save the lynx, a cat-not-possum creature. Political calculus surges: spank allies on the left to prove independence, echoing Bartlet's past evisceration of Christian moderates.

        Josh, rigid against walls to unwind doctor's orders, recoils at Marbury's appointment—'a lunatic Brit' Leo despises—while CJ preps the press on CARE's trillion-dollar benefits versus compliance costs. Bartlet accepts Sweden's Peter Hans, quipping about Goths toppling Rome, as Leo pitches NMD persistence: nine-of-ten successes, Apollo echoes. Toby seals the drop-in; Bartlet grumbles purity's curse but yields.

        Marbury crashes Leo's office like a Shakespearean tempest, buxom aides and royal lineage in tow, torching NMD as 'absurd boondoggle' breaching ABM treaties. In New York, CJ confronts comedian Cornelius Sykes over hosting the Will Rogers dinner—his infamous NYPD joke two years prior nearly torpedoed Bartlet's campaign. Sykes, wounded by Bartlet's non-disavowal and 'Hollywood sleaze' barbs, passes gracefully: 'I killed that night.' Backlash brews as Bartlet deviates off-script at GDC, blistering uncondemned arson. The crowd freezes—no roaring ovation, just stunned silence. Sam, scripting triumph, mourns the flop; Toby's spin crumbles under lobby firestorms.

        Night deepens in White House corridors. Sam seethes at Toby's exclusionary cynicism—'attacking friends for political cover'—as environmentalists unleash thesaurus-fueled fury: manipulative, third-party threats. Donna flirts royally with Marbury, who dangles five-year-old earls; Leo revives Yorktown whoopass amid Shahab-3 nightmares. Bartlet, battered by calls from Sierra Club and congressmen, demands Leo's motives aren't mere optics. In the Oval's sacred glow, Bartlet knights Marbury amid missile shield volleys—Marbury deems it suicidal escalation; Leo invokes nuclear irrelevance. Credentials sealed, flashes pop, but fault lines persist: policy idealism clashes with electoral terror, friendships fracture under drop-in debris, NMD dreams drift 137 miles astray. The West Wing churns on, purity's price etched in every unapplauded line.

        Tense anticipation grips the West Wing as staffers scramble through final tweaks to President Jed Bartlet's third State of the Union speech. Sam Seaborn seals a gritty deal—highway funds and a park naming for Senator McGowan's vote on the Blue Ribbon Commission—while Toby Ziegler axes 'vigorously' from campaign finance lines to dodge inflammation. Bartlet strides out, nerves cracking beneath his jacket as Charlie Young fastens it tight, the motorcade roaring toward the Capitol under flashing lights. Josh Lyman erupts at pollsters in the National Strategies Group, paranoia spiking over accents and gum-chewing amid Joey Lucas's delayed arrival.

        The speech detonates: Bartlet commands the chamber, applause thundering 73 times, unveiling the bipartisan commission on entitlements that Abbey Bartlet eyes warily on replay. Post-address euphoria surges—Josh hollers triumph, C.J. Cregg beams a '14' rating on Capital Beat—but cracks spiderweb fast. C.J. discovers paint-smeared pants from the sculpture garden, trading them for a gym robe that sparks Mrs. Landingham's deadpan query. Jack Sloane, the off-duty cop hailed by Bartlet for heroism at an elementary school, carries a 17-year-old reprimand for excessive force against robber Walter Tapus—a dismissed charge Sloane swears was self-defense, his track-star suspect too fleet otherwise.

        Polling frenzy grips Josh, who badgers deaf pollster Joey amid Donna Moss's relentless matchmaking prods. Power outage plunges the dial groups into darkness, stalling West Coast numbers as Josh's impatience boils. TV panels ignite: Ainsley Hayes dazzles on school uniforms, Gretchen Tyler counters ACLU fire, Toby shreds gun rights myths with global death stats. Abbey corners Toby, fury flaring over softened entitlements language—'partisan blinders' replacing ironclad Social Security vows—and the axed Violence Against Women Act, her $500 check to battered Jane Robinson framed unsent in a shelter.

        Crisis erupts in the Situation Room: CRF rebels seize five DEA agents at a Puente Mayo cocaine lab, badges blazing their doom. Leo McGarry rallies State, Justice, Pentagon; Mickey Troop urges negotiation with Nelson Guerra, but Leo snarls they're parade fodder. Special Ops crafts 'Cassiopeia'—Blackhawks, Littlebirds, gunship unleashing Delta commandos. Bartlet greenlights mobilization, three hours ticking to 'kick in the back door,' casualties be damned.

        Sam goads Bartlet into greeting terrified Ainsley Hayes, who dances adrenalized in a robe to 'Bossa Nova,' Pink Squirrel in hand—crash-landing into the President's wry sex-kitten quip. C.J. races Mark Gottfried's scoop on Sloane, pleading 20 minutes. Abbey confronts Jed in the kitchen, sandwich in hand, betrayal slicing deep: VAWA cut for reelection kickoff optics, their three-year deal shattered. Bartlet pivots to war footing, Abbey steels beside him as receptions pulse obliviously. Triumph sours into siege—political highs eclipsed by human peril, loyalty tested, power's razor edge gleaming.

'Go,' he snaps, igniting Cassiopeia—yet doubt flickers through Mickey's warnings of prolonged torture at Villa Cerreno. Smash to main titles, propelling into post-State of the Union chaos.

        C.J. corrals Officer Sloane, a heroic cop shadowed by a brutal past, thrusting him into Mark Gottfried's spotlight to spin excessive force charges into exoneration by grand jury and judges. Toby clashes with rumpled Sam at the ballroom, scorning Senator Gillette's pleas for Social Security fealty, his cigar smoke curling like frayed alliances. Josh fumes in blackout phone banks, Donna's teasing ignites sparks over Joey Lucas's allure, while Bartlet sacrifices chess bishops under portico stars, haunted by Vietnam caskets.

        Dawn cracks open tensions: Charlie unravels Mrs. Landingham's $500 mystery, a framed check from Abbey's mercy. Josh and Sam breakfast with Bartlet, who unleashes drug war fury—billions squandered, prisons bloated, victories illusory—demanding fresh ideas before bolting. Ainsley Hayes panics in Leo's closet, mistaking it for refuge, emerging to Bartlet's wry handshake amid paint-splattered memories. Toby eviscerates Gillette over Hyatt eggs, branding him a tiny fish ensnared in predatory tentacles, vowing to crush left-flank betrayals.

        Abbey packs with icy precision, her fury erupting at Bartlet—MS shredding his brain, a broken no-reelection pact—as aides flee the storm. Josh paces hold-hell, Donna dissecting polling obsession in Kentucky's 3rd, Missouri's shadows; Joey's numbers crater gun control dreams, yet her misdirection barb pierces: 'Numbers lie like Donna's denials.'

        Disaster detonates: Deltas hit dry hole, Blackhawk plummets under SAM fire, nine Americans shredded by Fronte's ham-radio ruse. Bartlet explodes on the portico, fists hammering thunder: 'They lured us to slaughter soldiers!' Rage yields to Colombian President Santos's offer—free Juan Aguilar, cocaine emperor, murderer of justices—for hostages. Roosevelt Room erupts: Toby roars principles over lives, Sam pleads humanity, but Bartlet slams folders, rejecting cartel victory.

        Situation Room grim math crushes dreams: 200,000 troops for 10:1 jungle bloodbath, half lost to heroin stakes. Abbey confronts anew, tears carving MS terror—fatigue, cognition crumbling—shattering their deal. Leo whispers Tonkin ghosts, urging shadow release: 'Santos owns it.' Bartlet stares into Oval night, Capote's lawless void tempting CIA blades, but yields Queen's gambit.

        Dover's tarmac gleams under motorcade lights; flag-draped coffins march past Bartlet's haunted gaze as C.J. briefs press on Santos's 'authority.' Hostages emerge from jungle hell, bodies home from ambush—war at home, prisons as battlefields, superpowers humbled.

Josh catches it live, bolts to CJ's office, transcript in hand, pulse racing. 'The Allman Brothers?' CJ gasps, horror mounting as wires hum with the scoop. Toby storms in, demanding they kill the interview retroactively; Sam piles on with a bizarre ad praising Bartlet for denouncing a movie—Prince of New York—he's never seen. Clocks tick mercilessly above the bullpen, staff scrambling through time zones as Bartlet jets back from Tokyo, fourteen hours ahead, landing in a dateline-defying Thursday twilight.

        Josh confronts Griffith in her office, her doctor's eye scanning his lingering scars from white supremacist bullets—blood pressure high, back pain psychosomatic. She stands unyielding: truth trumps politics, facts unchallenged. 'Resign,' he urges; she fires back, 'Fire me.' CJ spins support in the briefing room, dodging legalization labels, but Ellie Bartlet detonates the powder keg, phoning Danny Concannon: 'My father won't fire the Surgeon General—he'd never do that.' Bartlet touches down at Andrews, steel tariffs scorching his tongue, only to learn his middle daughter's rebellion blindsided him en route.

        Leo corners Griffith: committees circle like sharks, fundraising bonanza for the right. 'Resign by eight,' he growls. Toby wrestles Social Security's Blue Ribbon Commission, labor and seniors baying for Seth Gillette's head, but a no from him kills it. Ex-wife Andy Wyatt spars in his office, Danish crumbling under tension; Toby flips the script, plants her on a leukemia gala list, skips asking Gillette—announce him aboard tomorrow, Democrat unity triumphant. Sam hauls producer Morgan Ross into the hallway, eviscerates his Imus rant branding Bartlet cowardly: 'Celebrate choice, not censorship.'

        Bartlet explodes at Ellie in the Oval, rules ironclad—no kids to press—yet her defiance cracks his armor: 'She told the truth!' Father-daughter rift bleeds raw; she's always Abbey's, frightened by his towering command. Griffith tenders resignation amid Dial M for Murder's shadows, but Bartlet rips it up: 'You work for me.' In the screening room, he slides beside her, butchering medical specialties—podiatry, pediatrics, obstetrics—until laughter bubbles, tears glint. 'The only thing to make me happy was you coming home.' Truth endures, politics bends; Griffith stays, family mends, West Wing exhales as Hitchcock's key twists toward resolution.

        NSA evidence reveals the man's guilt as a Soviet spy, igniting a brutal clash
        between truth, compassion, and national betrayal.

        Sirens wail through Don Henley's haunting 'New York Minute' as dawn cracks over a barricaded Washington, thrusting the West Wing into Friday frenzy. Sam Seaborn jolts awake on Toby's couch, shirt rumpled, eyes hollow from his father's 28-year Santa Monica betrayal. Leo prods him homeward, but Sam dives into pardon recommendations—mail fraud, bogus busts—clinging to work as armor against family implosion. Protesters swarm Pennsylvania Avenue, choking streets around the World Bank; Metro cops reroute Leo's commute past National Geographic cordons, a surreal blockade fueling Sam's wry barbs.

        Big Block of Cheese Day erupts in the Roosevelt Room, Leo wielding Andrew Jackson's two-ton cheese legacy like a gavel. Staffers groan through assignments: CJ draws Organization of Cartographers for Social Equality, Larry hawks shark cartilage cancer cures, Donna guards Kemp's Ridley turtles. Toby, late from tourist hordes, blasts modern protesters as DMV disorganized—'68 vets like him knew underground fire. Leo dispatches him to World Policy Studies forum amid the 'amateurs,' no cameras, just wires. Josh needles Leo for the annual morale speech, but tradition holds: voiceless get their ear.

        Donna slips Stephanie Gault—old college ally, WTO advisor—into Sam's orbit on Cheese Day grace. Her grandfather Daniel Gault, FDR aide jailed for HUAC perjury, not espionage, haunts her dying father's quest for vindication. Sam's Princeton thesis already proved his innocence; Stephanie flatters his Presidential whisper. He pledges Justice heads-up, FBI courtesy call. Josh ribs him en route, trivia on Lincoln's last pardon a failed laugh amid Sam's frayed edges.

        Toby strides into protester chaos, Officer Rhonda Sachs guarding his flank. He mocks their camera surrender, sprawls with sports pages as chants of 'Global justice now!' ricochet. Webber wrangles the mob; Toby dismisses WTO gripes—free trade slashes prices, stops wars—yet eyes their pale faces, no Third World voices in blackest D.C. Sachs jabs Cabinet diversity; Toby storms back in, protesting to Josh for catharsis.

        Bartlet brushes ten-year projections like fairy dust, then stalls his library: first New Hampshire site felled by his own Historic Barn Act, backups cursed by burial grounds and jailed donors. Moody, he bolts at 7:30, phones swapped again, lamenting his last job's fleeting mastery—two years down, legacy looming.

        Sam storms FBI; Agent Casper slams doors, McCarthy lists no shield against jury acquittals. But Nancy McNally in the Sit Room drops the hammer: NSA cables crack Gault as 'Black Water,' Yalta delegate handing Roosevelt war plans, sympathizer rolls, Stalin edges—decrypted post-trial, hushed to guard the cipher. File thuds down, blacked just enough; Sam's certainty shatters.

        CJ battles cartographers' Peters Projection crusade: Mercator's imperialist sin bloats Greenland over Africa's fourteenfold might, shunts Germany northward, top-dog hemispheres breeding disdain. Flipped maps freak her—France where?—but size equals power, they hammer, undervaluing the global South.

        Night descends in the mess; Sam flings sugar packets, Donna corners him. He erupts—treason torches the idea of America, graves demand fidelity—but a murdered translator's ghost seals it: Gault's sins killed her hunt for Black Water. Donna begs delay; father's three months dwindle. Sam spares Stephanie brutal truth, feigns access snags, greenlights future tries. She beams, dials dad; Donna hugs Sam's collapse—longitude, latitude no surer than ideals.

        Josh recounts Toby's nova-hot dismantling of WTO ills, banana shrapnel his near-death. Wingmen rally: Toby, Josh drag Sam to oblivion, Donna trails. Alone, Sam dials Dad as sirens cry anew—love's tooth-and-nail grip against the wolf at bay. In a New York minute, everything fractures: pardons denied, spies unmasked, cheese blocks melt into moral quagmires, protesters fade, maps remapped, libraries lost. Betrayal binds fathers and sons, nations and ideals, truth a blade too sharp for fragile hopes.

      title: The Stackhouse Filibuster
      logline: A grizzled Minnesota senator unleashes a relentless filibuster, reading
        recipes to demand autism funding for his hidden grandson, forcing the White
        House to pivot from frustration to fierce advocacy amid stalled bipartisan
        health reforms and weekend dreams shattered.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Friday night crashes into chaos as Senator Howard Stackhouse, 78 and rasping through a head cold, grips the Senate floor with iron will, droning recipes from a cookbook to torpedo the Family Wellness Act. White House staff seethe—Sam eyes vanishing Hamptons trains, Josh mourns Mets spring training dreams of Mike Piazza's 'dude,' Toby chases Telluride flights, CJ skips her dad's 70th in Napa. Reporters clamour in the briefing room; CJ dangles pizza and sorbet quips to hold them hostage, betting the filibuster crumbles soon. But Stackhouse endures, hour eight bleeding into nine, voice cracking yet unyielding, defying all odds.

        Flashbacks ignite the fuse: Josh triumphs in Roosevelt Room negotiations, clinching $6 billion for child health—infant hearing tests, special needs adoption awareness—swallowing concessions like adoption lectures that irk NOW. Leo applauds; the bill seems sealed. Yet Stackhouse ambushes Josh on the Hill, new shoes pinching as he slips and demands $47 million for autism centers, CDC units, gene banks, doctor training. 'Eight tenths of one percent,' he snarls, skewering Alzheimer's and erectile dysfunction pork while kids suffer misdiagnoses. Josh stonewalls; Stackhouse dismisses him like yesterday's news.

        Subcurrents swirl. CJ hunts a cursed Egyptian cat statue for a visiting sheik, Crazy Gluing its shattered potpourri fate. Toby presses VP Hoynes on oil price gouging; the oil baron surprises, blasting profiteers at a presser—'old friends know how to turn a profit'—fueling Toby's suspicions amid leaked polls hinting Hoynes eyes presidential shadows, Bartlet's MS deal with Abbey looming unspoken.

        Donna cracks the code: B-roll footage tallies only six grandkids, not seven. Autism grips Stackhouse's hidden grandson. Revelation electrifies. Bartlet, mid-candlelit dinner with Leo—saffron chicken cooling, Tomate de Saltambique taunting—feels the grandfather's rage surge through him. 'Don't underestimate the will of a grandfather. We're mad men.' Screw print deadlines; they mobilize. Donna unveils the Senate loophole: yield for questions without losing the floor.

        Frenzy erupts. Staff phones explode, targeting grandfathers first—Grissom, McNamara, Gianelli. Bartlet vows calls to all 100 senators. Tension coils as Grissom strides in: 'Will the Senator yield for a question?' Stackhouse, blackjack rules fading, consents. Cheers shatter the bullpen; 28 senators flood the floor, grandfathers granting rest, water, real autism queries. Bill reopens. Stackhouse stands tall—no legs buckling, no voice silenced.

        CJ seals her email: politics unearths nobility amid partisanship's fog. Staff scatters to weekends redeemed; Stackhouse wins dignity. Bartlet glimpses redemption in curmudgeons, Hoynes maneuvers in shadows, CJ races to Napa. A filibuster births hope, proving grandfathers bend rules, shatter deadlines, and rally foes into allies. Black fog lifts; humanity triumphs.

        to President Bartlet''s re-election, storming into a devastating revelation:
        Bartlet''s secret Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis, igniting fury over deception
        and jeopardizing the administration''s fragile unity and future.'
      high_level_summary: |-
        Toby Ziegler hurls his rubber ball against the office wall, night after restless night, suspicions gnawing like a predator in the shadows. A TV drone about autism fades as crumpled papers pile high, his mind fixated on VP John Hoynes' inexplicable poll and oil-slapping bravado. Why probe public opinion six years early? Why the 'camping trip' to Killington with a detour to Nashua, New Hampshire—cradle of primaries? Toby corners Leo McGarry in the dim glow of his office, probing for whispers of dumping Hoynes in 2002. Leo stonewalls, but Toby's radar screams Eisenhower-Nixon redux.

        Obsession escalates. Toby ambushes Leo at dawn, decodes the semiconductor speech title as a high-tech corridor dog whistle. Leo squirms, glasses off, but Toby smells blood: Hoynes scents weakness, assumes Bartlet bows out. Smash to Oval Office, where President Jed Bartlet wrestles terror threats—embassies shuttered in Tanzania, Brussels; nitroglycerin smuggled in a U-Haul. Leo urges confession: Toby's too sharp, Hoynes' breadcrumbs deliberate. Bartlet sighs, 'Now it starts.'

        Parallel chaos erupts in the West Wing's underbelly. Josh Lyman chases Donna Moss with anniversary flowers she scorches as passive-aggressive barbs, their banter a ritual dance masking deeper scars—her car wreck, ex-boyfriend's beer detour en route to the hospital. Sam Seaborn recruits Ainsley Hayes for Correspondents' Dinner speech punch-up, their flirtatious sparring detonating over ERA: Ainsley skewers it as humiliating redundancy, 14th Amendment shield enough for her low-maintenance Republican soul. Josh's crew—Ed, Larry, Donna—devours Chinese, resurrects lame jokes, self-deprecates staff foibles, but laughter rings hollow amid unspoken dread.

        Pivotal collision: Oval Office bourbon flows, Bartlet drops the bomb. Ten years of fatigue, leg pain, blurry vision, MRI plaque—relapsing-remitting MS. Toby reels, speechless. 'The good kind,' Bartlet quips, no cure, episodes unpredictable. Toby bolts to the portico, Leo trails with secrets: 16 know—Abbey, docs, kids, Hoynes. Remission hides it from Bethesda physicals; no lies, just silence. Rage erupts: Kashmir crisis mid-episode? Unsigned incapacity letter post-assassination attempt? Ninety minutes of 'coup' with Leo at the helm?

        Thunder rumbles as FAA dithers on airport alerts—Reda Messam spills of a Patterson safe house, but odds shaky. Bartlet snaps, hurls folders, roars 'SHUT UP!' at Toby's indignation, laced with crap. They fracture, simmer. Toby grills Leo outside: Hoynes acted responsibly, bread crumbs for the party; seven months to Iowa, nominee in doubt. Hearings loom, impeachment whispers—no law broken, but trust shatters.

        Subplots humanize the storm. Donna bares her soul to Josh amid toppled bookshelves: accident lies stemmed from ex's callousness; Josh's grace her anchor. Sam and Ainsley clash in the mess—pay equity myths, procreation punishments, freedom's double edge—ending in her mortified exit, peachless.

        Climax crests: Bartlet owns no apology—MS personal, not Toby's domain. Fraud screams to voters denied choice. Toby tallies: 17 people now. Bartlet wearies, concedes stupidity, whispers 'I'm sorry.' Reconciliation flickers. Airports lock to Condition 2; threats neutralized, for now.

        Toby stumbles into Roosevelt Room revelry, ball tossed his way. Laughter envelops him—'lame duck' menus, NASDAQ not-for-profits—as Bartlet signs orders beyond French doors. Ball thuds rhythmically, echoing resolve amid betrayal's rubble. Secrecy binds them tighter, re-election gamble launches, loyalty tested in the crucible of concealed frailty. Stakes tower: presidency, party, personal demons unleashed.

      logline: President Bartlet enlists old ally Oliver Babish to probe if concealing
        his MS diagnosis during the campaign forged a criminal conspiracy, unraveling
        threads of perjury and loyalty as national crises erupt and a special prosecutor
        looms over his presidency.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Oliver Babish storms into the fray, gavel shattering a treacherous dictaphone as President Jed Bartlet lays bare his fear: did hiding relapsing-remitting MS from 16 insiders defraud America into electing a ticking time bomb? Bartlet dodges vacation bags, thrusts the confession at Babish amid Leo McGarry's steely gaze, igniting a probe that slices through depositions, lawsuits, and family secrets. Babish's questions hammer like federal land-use briefs—has Bartlet perjured on health forms? Lied under oath? The Oval's shadows deepen as Babish tallies the circle of knowing: doctors, family, Fitzwallace, Toby Ziegler, now clawing toward exposure.

        Chaos erupts beyond the counsel's door. Mexico's peso craters, dragging $30 billion in loans into freefall; Josh Lyman bullies Senate committees in the Roosevelt Room, crooning Wells Fargo wagons while Donna Moss skewers the bailout as taxpayer betrayal, her textiles worker's plight clashing against Josh's Lend-Lease firehose logic. An oil tanker, the Kensington Indio—Sam Seaborn's old Gage Whitney albatross—rams Delaware shores, hemorrhaging 720,000 gallons across crab graves and tourism dreams. Sam corners Lieutenant Emily Lowenbrau, anchor snapping in 25-foot seas, then tempts disbarment confessing the ship's cheap steering to Ainsley Hayes, who slams privilege shut.

        Toby Ziegler erupts over a voucher leak quote twisting Bartlet's veto threat into compromise bait; CJ Cregg hunts phantoms through 1,100 staffers, Jamie Hotchkiss bristling, Donna feigning guilt in Lindbergh baby farce. Toby's rage masks seismic tremors—he knows potatoes dwarf this leak, eyes darting from CJ's probe, throat clearing lies as MS's bad moon swells.

        Charlie Young freezes over Georgetown forms: Zoey's underage signature demands parental medical history—Bartlet's blanked MS line, Abbey's pen sealing perjury. He bolts to Leo, who seizes records, pulse racing. Bartlet corners Charlie under portico lamps, loyalty's blade flashing: one lie severs them forever. Then, Oval showdown—Bartlet offers Babish escape, but Oliver demands total surrender: staff briefing, public blast, a Bartlet-hating special prosecutor unleashed with army staff, unlimited war chest. No privilege, no mercy—depositions in kitchens, Hague war crimes. Bartlet whispers, 'Bring it on,' hands pocketed, moon rising blood-red over a presidency teetering on truth's razor edge.

        Crises collide in propulsive rhythm: Mexico yields to bailout signatures at dawn, oil slicks choke beaches, leaks fizzle under CJ's blanket denial. Yet beneath policy frenzy pulses the human fracture—loyalty's cost, deception's gravity. Bartlet, Nobel laureate turned confessor, stares down fraud's indictment, staff blind to the storm brewing in Babish's war room. Toby's evasion to CJ betrays the fracture lines; Charlie's brilliance vaults toward law school salvation. Power's corridors crackle with unspoken accusations, vicious circles of property taxes paling against MS's remorseless spin. Babish stays, chess unplayed, Chicago steel forging the fight. Fade to black as 'bring it on' echoes, stakes vaulting from election lie to constitutional Armageddon.

        subpoenas and political annihilation.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Dawn cracks over the White House Counsel's office as Oliver Babish corners C.J. Cregg, her defenses cracking under his relentless probe: Has she lied about the President's health? Her admission—'Many, many times'—ignites the fuse on a scandal threatening to engulf the Bartlet administration. Six hours into knowing about the MS, C.J. spars with the bulldog lawyer, her sarcasm a shield against accusations of complicity in federal crimes. Smash to main titles, tension already throttling.

        Josh's bullpen buzzes with Donna's panic over a fax: NASA's Zodiac satellite plummets from orbit, a garbage-truck-sized specter hurtling toward Earth. Laughter ripples—Ed and Larry mock her terror—but the real apocalypse looms inside. Leo stonewalls Toby and Josh's pleas for polling on public reaction to the MS bombshell, fearing leaks, yet greenlights Joey Lucas's clandestine survey disguised as attitudes toward a Michigan governor's hidden degenerative disease.

        Martin Connelly storms Josh's office, begging $30 million for the tobacco lawsuit draining Justice Department coffers against Big Tobacco's war chest. Josh pitches Leo, who balks at the fiscal black hole and congressional tobacco puppets blocking transfers. Meanwhile, Sam battles Progressive Caucus aides over clunky rhetoric in his SME speech—'bigger swimming pools and faster private jets' for the rich—dissing their class-warrior barbs as high-school drivel. CBO's slashed surplus projection hands them leverage: slower growth kills fat tax cuts for the wealthy.

        Abbey Bartlet barrels back from her trip, fury erupting in the Oval as Jed confesses withholding the MS from her, triggered by Zoey's Georgetown form exposing the family medical blank. 'How come I just found out?' she demands, their spousal armor fracturing amid exhaustion and fear. Babish hauls her in next, dismantling her 'I signed it without reading' defense with her MD credentials: a thoracic surgeon blind to a medical history form? MS isn't hereditary, she snaps, but Oliver warns of grand jury meat grinders ahead.

        Airport shadows cloak Josh's desperate pitch to Joey: 96 hours for a blind poll modeling Bartlet's lie. She nods, steely. Night deepens; Donna hounds Charlie on Zodiac's plutonium peril, oblivious to its routine skyfall. Abbey confides in C.J., both battle-scarred by Babish's vetting. Leo briefs Bartlet: poll's in field, Sam's summoned last. Toby echoes his vow to wait post-reveal.

        C.J. bolts into the night, Josh trailing. 'The President has this disease and has been lying about it,' she erupts, 'and you guys worry polling optics? It's the fall that's gonna kill ya!'—her slip from 'you' to 'us' binds them in shared doom. Josh deflects with Donna's satellite hysteria: 17,000 objects have rained down harmlessly; we're due. Pennsylvania Avenue sign fades to black, the plummet inevitable. Subplots—satellite farce, tobacco crusade, tax-cut trench warfare—underscore the core dread: disclosure's cliff-dive into indictments, betrayal, oblivion. Staff clings to bonds fraying under truth's gravity, the fall devouring all.

        Midnight shadows cloak the White House basement as President Jed Bartlet huddles with his inner circle—Leo McGarry, Josh Lyman, Sam Seaborn, Toby Ziegler, C.J. Cregg—around Joey Lucas's brutal poll numbers. Seventeen percent forgive the lie about his multiple sclerosis; seventy-one percent recoil from voting for a sick leader. Women over 55 bolt en masse, Democrats fracture, and fatal misconceptions doom trust. Bartlet absorbs the gut punch: 'They may be right.' Urgency ignites: a live Dateline special Wednesday night in the Mural Room, President and First Lady Abbey unmasked, followed by C.J.'s press conference cage match. But reelection? Silence hangs like a noose—no firm answer yet.

        Dawn cracks open parallel infernos. In Haiti, Colonel Bazan's troops crush president-elect Jean-Pierre Dessalines's victory rally, vanish him into Jake Bratt's car trunk racing for U.S. asylum. Port-au-Prince teeters: army tanks police stations, UN observers hunker. Bartlet orders non-essential embassy evacuations, Marines reinforce—Jake warns of standoff signals. Robbie Mosley urges restraint, but Leo roars: 'We saw to it there was a free election!' Dessalines breaches the gates; Bazan's forces encircle, AR-15s gleam (U.S.-sold), Bradleys loom with 120mm cannons against 37 Marines clutching M-14s. Nancy mobilizes the 8-80th Hostage Task Force. Shots crack: Haitian soldiers board the evac C-9; staff sergeants drop three, plane screams skyward. Bartlet erupts—'That wasn't supposed to happen!'—Leo counters: rules of engagement demand it. Diplomatic whispers via Canada, Dominicans; Bazan craves Dessalines for embezzlement charges. OAS emergency session looms.

        Josh battles Capitol Hill: Justice's tobacco lawsuit starves—31 lawyers versus tobacco's 4,676—Kalmbach buries funding, swayed by $460K PACs. Democrats Warren, Rossiter defect, scorning 'politically correct extortion.' Josh vows dynamite: C.J. blasts Congress publicly. Toby shocks Donna Moss with the MS bomb; she absorbs, steels for war. Sam clashes with Abbey over medical jargon—neuropathy, optic neuritis, Betaseron self-prescribed across state lines, ethics boards circling. Oliver Babish grills her: no records, family treatment taboo. Abbey demands to stand by Jed.

        Comedy pierces tension: Mrs. Landingham, widowed Delores, haggles her first new car—blue beauty, AC humming, that dashboard freedom scent. Charlie ribs her sticker-price folly, ethics shield her from discounts. Bartlet teases, offers to cover the gap; she beams independence.

        Night deepens resolve. Staff converges on Leo's office, demanding reelection clarity—Sam spouts vestibulo-cochlear vertigo, eyes roll. Leo snaps: full steam on all fronts, no detours. C.J. secures networks sans logos. Josh lights fuses on tobacco foes.

        Then devastation: Charlie's voice cracks—drunk driver T-bones Mrs. Landingham at 18th and Potomac. She's gone. Leo staggers, aged decades, veranda lights mocking his frailty. French doors part; Bartlet turns. Through warped glass, Leo delivers the blow. Worlds fracture. Haiti simmers, MS looms, but grief eclipses all—stakes eternal, presidency shadowed by irreplaceable loss.

        Lightning cracks the sky as President Jed Bartlet reels from the shattering news: his fiercely loyal secretary, Mrs. Landingham, lies crushed by a drunken driver mere days after buying her first new car. Democrats swarm Leo McGarry's office, throats tightening with panic over Bartlet's concealed multiple sclerosis—MS, the ticking bomb that could doom their House majority and trap the reelection campaign in the Rose Garden. 'The President has got to strongly consider not running,' Congressman Wade blurts, the 35th such gut-punch that morning. Bartlet presses forward, steeling for her funeral at Washington National Cathedral while White House gears grind: Toby Ziegler barks lighting cues for an impending press conference, C.J. Cregg dodges tobacco funding fights and embargoed leaks, Josh Lyman ignites firebrand releases, Sam Seaborn slams the door on defeatist strategists plotting a Hoynes handover.

        Haitian embassy siege boils in the Situation Room—1,200 troops, howitzers aimed at the front door, a diabetic deputy chief rationing insulin. Bartlet dispatches Joint Chiefs Chairman Fitzwallace to fracture the enemy, his mind fracturing into vivid flashbacks: young Jed, teenage rebel at his father's New Hampshire prep school, clashes with spirited new secretary Dolores Landingham. She catches him with a cigarette butt in chapel, introduces equal pay crusades, demands he confront Dad the headmaster. 'You're a Boy King,' she prods, igniting his spine against injustice—women's salaries, banned books, Catholic doctrine clashing with Protestant services. Slaps sting from Dr. Bartlet's hand; resolve hardens in Jed's gut.

        Motorcade sirens wail to the cathedral's soaring arches, rose window ablaze in spring light. Abbey Bartlet probes the void: party elders push Hoynes, girl driver faces manslaughter. Bartlet stares through silence, exhaling exhaustion into the pew. Reverend Monohan's words blur into memory—Mrs. Landingham hosing sculls, wielding numbers like weapons: Florence Chadwick underpaid versus Hopkins, choir mistresses shortchanged for crew coaches. 'You've known it since before that,' she insists, mirroring Bartlet's stalled car, stalled convictions. Casket lifts on pallbearers' shoulders—Toby, Sam, Josh, Charlie—staff tears carving paths as processional echoes.

        Alone now, cathedral sealed, Bartlet erupts at the altar, fists clenched, Latin fury spilling: 'Cruciatus in crucem! You feckless thug!' Sins confessed—MS lies, tender ship sunk with 68 souls, Josh's shooting as 'warning shot.' Cigarette grinds under heel: 'You get Hoynes!' Betrayal chokes him down the aisle.

        Back at the White House, storm rages. Staff fractures: Sam paces, demanding abort the press conference; Toby storms from Greg Summerhays' cable news lifeboat, Leo's secret parachute sparking rage. 'I'm gonna rip his arms off!' Bartlet drops the MS bomb in a taped interview—blurred vision, numb legs, relapsing-remitting diagnosis—Wall Street trembles, markets hemorrhage. C.J. drills podium cues: 'Altman, first row right.' Donna Moss fields tropical storm fixation—May anomaly, 34-knot winds defying seasons.

        Flashback venom resurfaces: young Jed's slapped rebellion, door slammed on salary pleas. Thunder hurls veranda doors wide; hallucination summons Mrs. Landingham, small and unyielding: 'God doesn't make cars crash.' She counters his pity party with brutal stats—44 million uninsured, homicide claiming black men under 35, 13 million kids in poverty, crumbling schools begging $127 billion. 'If you don't run 'cause it's too hard... God, Jed, I don't even want to know you.' Empty chair echoes as Bartlet steps into rain, washing doubt from his face.

        Limo slices night pours to State Department. C.J. fields frenzy—special prosecutor looms, subpoenas for staff. Bartlet strides soaked, towel dabbing resolve. Podium awaits; eyes lock on Altman. Instead, hands slide to pockets, gaze drifts away, sly smile cracks—callback to Landingham's victory read: hands pocketed, eyes averted, decision sealed. Sandy demands: 'Seeking a second term?' Bartlet feigns deafness, repeats the gauntlet. Staff holds breath; Leo whispers, 'Watch this.' Brothers in arms endure—Bartlet surges back, unbroken, reelection thunder rolling.
