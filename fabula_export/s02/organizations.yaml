  description: 'General Barrie thunders into C.J.''s office, slamming the 10th Mountain
    Division''s C4 rating—unfit for service at Fort Drum—as damning proof of military
    decay. This U.S. Army light infantry division, honed for mountain warfare, ignites
    the readiness showdown: Barrie wields its downgrade to savage post-Cold War Pentagon
    priorities, chaining it to broader critiques of force structure and deployability.
    C.J. parries with policy precision, but the unit''s tainted status hangs heavy,
    exposing hypocrisies in valor and vigilance amid national security brinkmanship.'

    loyalists, and anchors family legacies—her grandfather helms a state chairmanship.
