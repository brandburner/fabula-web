    dedicated to protecting the Holy Grail's secret location for a thousand years.
    Members bear a cruciform sword tattoo or birthmark. They stand ready to take any
    action to prevent discovery, acting as antagonists who interrogate seekers' motives—such
    as Indiana Jones's quest for his father rather than divine glory. In the confrontation
    aboard the freighter, Kazim withholds his father Henry Jones Sr.'s location at

    Elsa Schneider names them famous art collectors to Indiana Jones during their
    stormy arrival, deflecting his questions about the castle. Indy flags their reputation
    as suspicious, linking it to potential Nazi ties amid Austria's occupation. The

    a contested landscape where modern powers like the Republic of Hatay, Nazis via

    They launch ambushes and shootouts to eliminate rivals, as shown when they attack
    Indiana Jones and Willie Scott in the Dragon nightclub. Firing pistols amid panicked
    crowds, they shatter glass and block exits to trap their targets, enforcing deals

    grant passage. The police advance on Lao Che and Kao Kan's pursuing henchmen,

    The Sinister Man invokes it to pose as an official escort, targeting Marcus Brody
    amid the chaos of Iskenderun's train station. This ruse exploits Brody's confusion
    in foreign surroundings, drawing him toward a Nazi troop truck for capture. Sallah
    spots the deception and fights back, but Brody falls for the ploy. The fake museum

  description: |-
    The Nazi Regime (commonly referred to as 'Nazis' in narrative contexts) is the fascist government of Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, that commands military forces and collaborators (e.g., Walter Donovan, Elsa Schneider, Colonel Vogel) to execute global operations targeting historical artifacts (Holy Grail, Ark of the Covenant), Allied figures (Henry Jones Sr., Marcus Brody), and strategic resources. The regime operates through:
      - **Military Structure**: Armed squads, SS officers, radiomen, and specialized units (e.g., zeppelin crews, motorcycle patrols) deployed across Europe, the Middle East, and America.
      - **Tactics**: Kidnappings, ambushes, sabotage (e.g., petroleum facilities), and relentless chases to acquire relics for ideological goals (e.g., immortality via the Grail).
      - **Collaboration Network**: Leverages sympathizers (e.g., Donovan) and occupied infrastructure (e.g., Brunwald Castle, underground harbors) to expand influence.
      - **Ideology**: Propagandizes dehumanization of enemies (e.g., mocking Americans as 'weak fighters') and prioritizes artifact acquisition over human life, mirroring their Ark of the Covenant campaign.
      The regime’s actions drive high-stakes antagonism against Indiana Jones and Allied forces, embodying brutal control and global-scale operations.
