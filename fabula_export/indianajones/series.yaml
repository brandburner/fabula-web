      title: Raiders of the Lost Ark
      written_by: Lawrence Kasdan
      logline: Indiana Jones, a rugged archaeologist, races to locate the Ark of the
        Covenant before Nazi forces and rival antiquarian Emile Belloq, confronting
        ancient traps, betrayal, and a divine power that could grant catastrophic
        military supremacy.
      high_level_summary: |-
        1936. Indiana Jones opens the story in the Peruvian Andes, forcing his way into the vegetation-enshrouded Temple of the Chachapoyan Warriors to steal a small jeweled idol. He survives booby traps, kills a treacherous guide, and escapes after his partner Satipo betrays him, taking the idol and dying in the temple’s mechanisms. At the temple’s edge Indy surrenders the idol to Emile Belloq, a charming but lethal French antiquarian who commands native warriors; Belloq emerges as Indy’s mirror—an equally brilliant but morally compromised rival.

        Back in the United States, Army Intelligence recruits Jones after intercepting a Nazi communiqué: the Germans seek pieces of a headpiece — the Staff of Ra — that will point to Tanis, the lost city that houses the Ark of the Covenant. Indy explains the Staff-of-Ra mechanism to officials: when assembled and placed in a map room, the Staff’s headpiece will illuminate the location of the Well of the Souls that hides the Ark. He heads to Shanghai, steals the headpiece section from Tengtu Hok’s museum amid samurai guards and a collapsing gong, and then travels to Nepal.

        In Patan, Indy locates Marion Ravenwood, daughter of his old teacher Abner Ravenwood, who runs a rough bar called The Raven. Marion still hates Indy for past betrayals but agrees to help after he offers money for a small sun-shaped medallion that completes the headpiece. Marion’s pain and stubbornness soften into partnership; their volatile chemistry becomes an engine for the plot. Together with Sallah, a resourceful Egyptian excavator Indy recruited in Cairo, they weld the medallion to the base, recover the full headpiece, and travel to the Nazi dig at Tanis.

        At Tanis, Indy sneaks into the ancient map room, places the assembled Staff of Ra in the correct mosaic slot, and locates the true site of the Well of the Souls—one foot beyond the Nazis’ chosen spot. He sabotages their calculations, then teams with Sallah and Arab diggers to open the Well. They lower torches, clear a path over thousands of deadly asps, and uncover the stone chest that contains the Ark. Nazis, led by Colonel Shliemann and aided by Belloq, trap Indy and Marion in the Well but then remove the Ark and load it onto a convoy bound for Cairo.

        Indy pursues the convoy on horseback, commandeers the truck carrying the crate, and outmaneuvers Nazi vehicles through mountain roads and Cairo’s streets. Marion, captured earlier and shipped on a freighter with the Ark, reunites with Indy after a daring rescue. The Nazis board the tramp steamer Bantu Wind, seize the Ark, and transport it by submarine to a fortified island base. Indy stows on the sub periscope and follows them into a cavernous underground complex. The base houses a surreal Tabernacle where Belloq, obsessed, prepares a ceremonial opening of the Ark.

        Indy interrupts the ritual with a bazooka threat and negotiates for Marion’s release, but command protocols and rivalries complicate matters. Shliemann insists on tested procedure; Belloq insists on the mystical. When Belloq slips an ivory rod into the Ark and lifts the lid, divine force explodes from the artifact: blinding light and a horrific sound that incinerates the Nazis and consumes Belloq in an ecstatic death. Indy and Marion survive by turning away and closing their eyes; they rescue the Ark, harness it, and escape through collapsing tunnels while the base explodes in a chain of munitions detonations.

        The film closes in Washington. Army officials and bureaucrats debrief Indy, Brody, and Marion; the government claims the Ark for “top secret” study. The final image shows the Ark nailed shut in a crate stamped TOP SECRET and wheeled into a cavernous government warehouse, a quiet but ominous coda that leaves the artifact’s true power locked away under official custody.

        Through action and spectacle the screenplay tracks Indy’s persistent pragmatism and moral code: he pursues knowledge and sees antiquities as cultural artifacts, not weapons. Belloq’s arc of obsession and willing compromise contrasts with Marion’s evolution from embittered survivor to active partner and romantic equal. The story juxtaposes archaeological curiosity with the political hunger for absolute power and dramatizes the danger of trying to weaponize religious mysteries. It resolves with survival and a hard-won intimacy for Indy and Marion, but leaves the central moral question intact: who should control things that exceed human understanding?

      title: Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
      written_by: Willard Huyck & Gloria Katz
      logline: Renowned archaeologist Indiana Jones must recover a powerful ancient
        artifact stolen from an Indian village by a bloodthirsty cult, navigating
        deadly booby traps, a malevolent priest, and the cult's attempts to brainwash
        him, while protecting his young sidekick and a reluctant nightclub singer.
      high_level_summary: |-
        In 1935 Shanghai, archaeologist Indiana Jones narrowly escapes a double-cross by a crime lord during a relic exchange, fleeing with nightclub singer Willie Scott and his young protégé, Short Round. Their plane is sabotaged and crashes in the remote Indian countryside, where they are found by villagers from Mayapore. The village chieftain and a shaman tell a desperate story: their sacred protective stone was stolen, their lands became barren, and their children were taken. They believe a divine power sent Jones to retrieve the stone from the nearby Pankot Palace.

        Despite initial skepticism, Jones discovers a tattered manuscript fragment on a rescued village boy depicting the Sankara Stones—five magical artifacts. Compelled, he leads his companions to Pankot. The palace, under the rule of a young Maharajah and his Prime Minister Chattar Lal, initially presents a facade of opulent hospitality. The veneer cracks that night when assassins attack Jones in his room. Discovering a secret passage, Jones, Willie, and Short Round witness a horrific Thuggee ceremony in a vast underground temple. The High Priest, Mola Ram, performs a ritualistic human sacrifice and reveals three of the Sankara Stones, their power fueling the cult’s resurgence.

        Jones attempts to steal the stones but is captured. Mola Ram forces him to drink the 'blood of Kali,' plunging him into a trance of servitude to the death goddess. While enslaved children toil in mines beneath the temple searching for the remaining stones, a brainwashed Jones nearly allows Willie to be sacrificed. Short Round breaks the spell by inflicting physical pain, shocking Jones back to his senses.

        The trio escapes into the mines, liberating the enslaved children and sparking a revolt. Pursued by the cult, they commandeer a mine car for a frantic chase through underground tunnels, narrowly outpacing a cataclysmic tidal wave released by their enemies. Their flight culminates on a precarious rope bridge spanning a deep gorge. Cornered, Jones severs the bridge, sending cultists to their deaths. In a final struggle with Mola Ram on the collapsing structure, Jones invokes an ancient warning against betraying the stones' true purpose. The magical artifacts reject Mola Ram, burning him and causing him to fall to his death in the crocodile-infested river below, though all but one stone are lost.

        Jones, Willie, and Short Round return to Mayapore with the freed children. They find the village miraculously restored to fertility and life. Jones returns the last Sankara Stone to its shrine, its power now serving its rightful purpose. Having found neither fortune nor glory, but having thwarted an ancient evil, Jones sets off with his companions, their bond forged by the ordeal.
