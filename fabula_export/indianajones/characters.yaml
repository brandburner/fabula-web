    Thuggee Guards are the primary enforcers of the Thuggee cult in Pankot Palace, operating across both the mine tunnels and ritual chambers. They serve High Priest Mola Ram and the possessed Maharajah Zalim Singh, with responsibilities including:
      - **Mine Tunnel Enforcement**: Overseeing enslaved children extracting Sankara Stones, using whips and physical force to suppress resistance. They exhibit mechanical obedience under Kali's hypnotic influence, dragging away disobedient guards and forcing workers back to labor.
      - **Cult Rituals & Security**: Restraining captives, guarding sacred sites, and pursuing intruders with coordinated precision during rituals and chases. Their ranks number in the dozens, armed with chains, whips, and rifles.
      - **Fanatical Loyalty**: Demonstrating ruthless execution of tortures and ambushes, scattering only under sudden threat. Their authority stems from direct service to Thuggee high priests, prioritizing cult control over individual mercy.

      The term 'Thuggee Mine Guards' refers to a subset of these enforcers specifically assigned to the mine tunnels, but all Thuggee Guards operate under the same cult hierarchy and share identical traits of obedience, brutality, and fanaticism.
