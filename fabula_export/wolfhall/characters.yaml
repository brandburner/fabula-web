    VII as leader of the Roman Catholic Church. Cromwell weighs his chances, citing
    Farnese's children as a mark of his worldly status and the shifting alliances
    that boost his papal prospects. Farnese navigates the College of Cardinals with
    ties to Italian families and European courts, balancing reform demands from England
    against entrenched Curial power. His potential election shapes the church's response

    family's position in the court.

  title_role: Lord Montague
  description: Henry Montague (Lord Montague), descendant of the Yorkist Plantagenet
    line, claims potential right to Henry VIII's throne. As a leader of the conservative
    noble faction opposing Anne Boleyn, he aligns with traditionalist forces resisting
    royal reforms. His presence at court—seated with the Duke of Norfolk, Henry Courtenay,
    and Lady Margaret Pole—marks his alignment with factions resisting Anne Boleyn's
    influence. Executed in 1538 for treason, his reserved and watchful demeanor reflects
    the cautious nobility awaiting power shifts. Mentioned in Barton's visions as
    a dynastic rival, he embodies the strategic opposition to Tudor reforms.

    He lollops around guests like Stephen Gardiner, grinning broadly, and pelts diners
    with bread crusts from the gallery above, hooting like an owl and shouting blasphemies.
    More deems him excitable, and he obeys calls to return indoors from Cromwell or
    More. His antics disrupt formal dinners and garden talks, exposing unruly undercurrents
    in the disciplined home amid Tudor religious tensions. Playful chaos defines his
    role, puncturing pretension through licensed folly.

  title_role: Bishop
  description: John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester in early Tudor England, is a leading
    Catholic cleric who fiercely resists Henry VIII's break with Rome. A devout traditionalist,
    he cultivates alliances with prophetic visionaries like Elizabeth Barton and noble
    Catholic families (e.g., Courtenays, Montagues), publicly signaling support for
    their anti-reformist prophecies. His defiance culminates in interrogation by Thomas
    Cromwell over writings against the king, where he initially asserts dignity but
    ultimately yields to fear under pressure. Thomas More later cites Fisher's execution—conducted
    with relative mercy—as a moral example of principled resistance. Fisher's navigation
    of court politics through clerical networks embodies principled opposition to
    royal supremacy, driven by doctrinal loyalty despite rising Protestant pressures.
    His alliances with figures like Thomas More and the Duke of Exeter further cement
    his role as a focal point of Catholic resistance. Fisher is also known for his
    vocal opposition to Henry VIII’s divorce from Catherine of Aragon and his execution
    in 1535 for refusing to recognize Anne Boleyn’s queenship.

  description: Little Bilney, a zealous priest and lawyer in early Tudor England,
    preaches William Tyndale's English Bible publicly and rejects Catholic rituals
    like masses and pardons. He aligns with reformist circles at Gray’s Inn, where
    he collaborates with Thomas Cromwell, James Bainham, and William Tyndale. Despite
    warnings from Cromwell about threats from heresy hunters like Thomas More and
    Stephen Gardiner, Bilney’s unyielding commitment to reform leads him to defy arrest
    risks, delivering street sermons in Norwich that draw the attention of guards.
    His martyrdom by burning in Norwich cements his legacy as a key figure in the
    struggle against Catholic orthodoxy during the decline of Cardinal Wolsey.

    targets in the consolidation of Tudor power. Their exclusion reflects their role
    as symbols of old aristocracy and Catholic dissent, embodying the broader conflict
    between tradition and reform. Margaret's guardianship of Princess Mary further
    cements the family's political significance, making their prosecution a calculated

    as symbols of old aristocracy and Catholic dissent, embodying the broader conflict
    between tradition and reform. Margaret's guardianship of Princess Mary further
    cements the family's political significance, making their prosecution a calculated
    risk for Cromwell.

  title_role: null
  description: Thomas Cromwell's nephew and a key figure in the Austin Friars household,
    serving as a trusted political advisor, protector, and deputy. Young, assertive,
    and outspoken, Richard handles family errands (e.g., trips to Antwerp), navigates
    Tudor court dynamics alongside his cousin Gregory Cromwell, and assists in crises
    like royal medical care. Playful in family settings with brother Gregory and Rafe
    Sadler, he balances youthful mischief with steadfast reliability. Independent
    and morally principled, Richard challenges his uncle's pragmatic maneuvers while
    engaging directly with figures such as Anne Boleyn, Francis Bryan, Thomas More,
    Henry VIII, and Eustace Chapuys. His defiance and curiosity reflect a personal
    conviction that often clashes with the coercive alliances of Tudor politics.

  title_role: null
  description: The French represent France's collective political and religious establishment
    under King Francis I, a Catholic power wary of Henry VIII's Reformation. Their
    reported aversion to England's doctrinal shifts bolsters conservative voices like
    Stephen Gardiner, who cite French outrage to curb reformist advances. As diplomatic
    heavyweights, they exert pressure through alliances, court gossip, and shared
    faith, embodying continental resistance to Protestant innovation while navigating
    uneasy ties with Tudor England.

  title_role: null
  description: The Poles (also known as the Pole family) represent a powerful aristocratic
    lineage in Tudor England, serving as staunch defenders of Catholic orthodoxy and
    traditional hierarchies during the reign of Henry VIII. As a cornerstone of the
    old Catholic nobility, they face marginalization and displacement due to Cromwell's
    Protestant reforms. Key figures include Margaret Pole, whose open defiance of
    Cromwell epitomizes the family's resistance to the new order. The Poles align
    with conservative aristocrats like Sir Nicholas Carew, maneuvering through court
    rivalries to safeguard their status amid religious and political upheaval. Their
    plight underscores the broader struggle between traditionalist houses (e.g., Courtenays)
    and reformist upstarts, revealing motivations rooted in the preservation of ancient
    privileges against innovation. The family embodies the fading Catholic nobility,
    united in resistance to the new order, and their downfall highlights the ruthless
    shift from traditional houses to reformist upstarts.

  description: The State embodies the Tudor monarchy's apparatus of justice and retribution.
    It orchestrates public executions as rituals of power, deploying scaffolds, executioners,
    and crowds to dismantle fallen ministers and traitors. Impersonal and mechanistic,
    it prioritizes spectacle over mercy, reducing individuals to symbols of royal
    vengeance. Aligned with Henry VIII's court, it enforces hierarchy through fear,
    contrasting human bonds with institutional brutality. Its logic demands total
    destruction of enemies like Cromwell, ensuring political order endures beyond
    personal loyalties.

  description: Thomas Cromwell ascends from Putney blacksmith's son to Henry VIII's
    chief minister, Earl of Essex, and Lord Privy Seal. Wolsey's former chief aide,
    he engineers royal divorces, monastery dissolutions, and alliances like Anne of
    Cleves' marriage while directing son Gregory, nephew Richard Cromwell, and protégé
    Rafe Sadler. Locked in combat with nobles Norfolk, Gardiner, Fitzwilliam, and
    Richard Riche, Cromwell fuses lowborn grit, legal mastery, and fierce loyalty
    into pragmatic reforms amid lethal court factions. Even imprisoned, his wit and
    resolve define him as ambition's tragic architect.

  description: Thomas Wyatt (also known as 'Tom Wyatt') is a poet and courtier in
    Henry VIII's Tudor court, entangled in the political and personal intrigues of
    the era. He is dogged by rumors of intimacy with Anne Boleyn, which cast him as
    a vulnerable figure in the court's lethal politics. Wyatt's alliances with Thomas
    Cromwell place him in webs of intrigue, where his bold challenges to nobles reveal
    his volatile yet astute nature. Known for blending poetic bravado with self-pity,
    offering lavish gifts (e.g., a Turkish dagger), and pleading for diplomatic exile
    to escape courtly aimlessness. Briefly detained in the Tower of London during
    Anne Boleyn's downfall, he is shielded by Cromwell and later released. His character
    embodies the court's mix of intellect, peril, and the fusion of personal liaisons
    with political survival. Traits include boldness, volatility, fearfulness, and
    political vulnerability.

  description: 'Walter Cromwell is Thomas Cromwell''s father and a blacksmith in Putney.
    Powerfully built into his sixties, he embodies the brutal working-class roots

    by secretly paying off the family of a young man Thomas killed—all without seeking
    acknowledgment. Estranged from Thomas as an adult, Walter remains a looming presence
    in the family''s emotional fractures, scorned by Thomas for his working-class
    roots and dismissed by Liz and Kat. He interacts with Thomas, Kat Cromwell, Anne
    Cromwell, Grace Cromwell, Rafe Sadler, Stephen Gardiner, and the Young Man''s
