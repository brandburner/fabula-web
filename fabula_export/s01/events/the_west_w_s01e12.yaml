  title: Shattered Pitcher — The President Collapses
  description: During a late-night State of the Union run-through, President Bartlet's
    practiced composure frays under fever and exhaustion. Small misreads and teleprompter
    typos spark nervous corrections and wry deflection; staffers watch him pale and
    sweating, realizing his body may be failing the public persona. Bartlet retreats
    to the Oval to 'take the pills' and, moments later, collapses beside a broken
    Steuben pitcher. The Secret Service's terse "Liberty's down" detonates private
    vulnerability into an immediate national emergency, converting concealment into
    a decisive turning point that will force medical disclosure and crisis management.

    description_of_involvement: The press podium frames the President's public posture
      during the run‑through; it is the stage for misreads and corrections that reveal
      physical strain and the spot where Bartlet performs before retreating.
    status_before_event: Occupied by the President during the rehearsal, holding notes
      and TelePrompTer feed.
    status_after_event: Vacant after the President leaves for the Oval; remains as
      an emblem of the staged performance that began to break down.

      copy and contains visible typos (e.g., 'million' vs. 'billion', pound sign in
      'hallowed') that trigger corrections, comedic beats, and early concern about
      cognitive clarity during rehearsal.
    status_before_event: Mounted at the lectern, scrolling the speech text; functioning
      but containing typographical errors.

    description_of_involvement: The Steuben glass pitcher (a ceremonial gift) is invoked
      humorously by the President as he promises to pour water; it then becomes a
      dramatic physical marker when found shattered beside the President after he
      collapses, linking domestic artifact to institutional vulnerability.
    status_before_event: On the Oval desk as a decorative/functional gift from the
      Christian Charity Network.

      wetness from spilled water marks the scene.
  - object_uuid: object_66a5b3fed9e7
    description_of_involvement: The shattered glass pitcher (the same Steuben now
      described as broken) supplies an audible cue (CRASH) that precipitates staff
      rushing in; its fragments and pooled water are tangible proof of the collapse
      and force immediate triage.
    status_before_event: Not broken; located intact on the Oval desk.
    status_after_event: Fragmented and scattered on the Oval carpet with water spilled,
      evidence of the moment and potential hazard for responders.
  - object_uuid: object_b4ca32ae9597
    description_of_involvement: A small resealable bag of pills is waved by the President
      as proof of intent to 'take the pills'—a prop signaling private self‑care and
      vulnerability, invoked to reassure staff before the collapse.
    status_before_event: In the President's possession (waved in the hallway), contents
      identified as vitamins/echinacea.
    status_after_event: Presumed left in or near the Oval when the President collapses;
      its reassurance function is negated by the medical emergency.
  - object_uuid: object_95db67eb444f
    description_of_involvement: A plain glass of water intended for swallowing the
      pills is referenced as part of Bartlet's plan to take medication; later the
      same water is implicated by spilled water near the broken pitcher where he collapses.
    status_before_event: On the Oval desk near the Steuben pitcher, full and ready
      to be used with pills.
    status_after_event: Spilled on the carpet next to the shattered pitcher and the
      unconscious President, contributing to visual evidence of the collapse.

  title: 'Denial in the Oval: Bartlet''s Collapse Exposed'
  description: During a late-night State of the Union run-through, President Bartlet’s
    practiced humor and deflection crack into visible illness. Josh and C.J., watching
    on a monitor, press him in the hallway as he dismisses sweating, pallor and missed
    lines with jokes about pills. Their nervous banter slides into urgent concern;
    Bartlet insists he’s fine and promises to take his pills. Moments later a glass
    pitcher shatters and he lies unconscious—an offhand Secret Service call, “Liberty’s
    down,” converts a private medical emergency into an immediate national crisis
    and narrative turning point.

      stage from which Bartlet reads and where TelePrompTer errors are manifest; its
      presence frames the public performance the staff are preparing and contrasts
      with the private emergency that follows.
    status_before_event: In use by the President during the run‑through, notes and
      teleprompter engaged.

      Bartlet's cadence, prompting on‑the‑fly corrections and exposing strain in his
      delivery. Typos force staff intervention, heighten rehearsal tension, and catalyze
      the hallway confrontation where physical symptoms are first noticed.
    status_before_event: Mounted at the lectern, scrolling speech copy but containing
      typographical errors (e.g., 'million' instead of 'billion').
    status_after_event: Acknowledged as faulty; Sam departs to fix typos but the device's

    description_of_involvement: The Steuben glass pitcher is named by Bartlet as the
      ceremonial source of the water he will use to swallow his pills; it functions
      as a domestic prop that ties public image to private ritual, and then becomes
      the literal artifact that breaks when the President collapses, marking the spot
      of his fall.
    status_before_event: Intact, positioned in the Oval Office as a gifted ceremonial
      piece (referenced by Bartlet during the hallway exchange).
    status_after_event: Shattered on the Oval carpet; fragments and spilled water
      lie beside the unconscious President, signaling the rupture of control.

  title: Liberty's Down — Rhetoric Rift and the President's Collapse
  description: 'During pre-State of the Union preparations, a seemingly small copyedit
    explodes into an ideological fight: Toby demands the speech defend government’s
    role while Josh pushes a populist, ''big government is over'' line. Meanwhile
    Bartlet jokes to deflect obvious physical symptoms — sweating, coughing, misreading
    the TelePrompTer — and promises to ''take the pills.'' He withdraws to the Oval,
    shatters a glass pitcher and collapses unconscious. A Secret Service agent''s
    blunt ''Liberty''s down'' turns private concern into an immediate national emergency,

  title: 'Preemptive Damage Control: C.J. Reveals the Leak'
  description: 'C.J. bursts into Leo''s office to confirm Abbey is returning and delivers
    a cold, political fact: the story about Leo''s past is already leaking online.
    The exchange condenses private panic into a procedural decision—Abbey is en route,
    Hackett with the feverish President, and the staff must choose containment over
    surprise. C.J. pushes for a preemptive media strategy and insists on working directly
    with Leo to craft the message. The beat functions as a turning point: the private
    crisis becomes public risk and forces an immediate containment plan while exposing
    Leo''s isolation and C.J.''s role as the administration''s defensive firewall.'

      as having been broken in the Oval Office earlier; though not present in the
      bedroom, the broken pitcher functions as a tactile clue that the fainting episode
      had a physical aftermath and as a domestic symbol that the veneer of control
      has cracked.
    status_before_event: Previously intact on the Oval Office desk as a decorative
      gift.
    status_after_event: Revealed by Bartlet's admission to have been broken earlier

  title: Choosing the Designated Survivor
  description: 'An urgent invitation to the State of the Union propels Josh into a
    cold, practical calculus: someone in the presidential line must be kept away.
    Margaret''s doorstep reminder — ''pick a guy'' — forces the abstract contingency
    into a named choice. Donna, eager and brash, offers herself; Josh gently explains
    the gravity and routine of the ''designated survivor'' protocol, then names Secretary
    Roger Tribby. His final admonition to ''be sweet to Margaret and Leo'' underlines
    the personal stakes behind this dry, procedural decision, setting up a consequential
    contingency and human fallout.'

    description_of_involvement: Leo's compact executive office is the confined, high-pressure
      site where private shame and public obligation collide; it hosts the rehearsal,
      the questioning, and Leo's definitive instruction that staff protect the President,
      not him.
    observed_atmosphere: Tension-filled with clipped dialogue, quiet urgency, and
      the close, almost claustrophobic feel of urgent private counsel.
    functional_role: Meeting place for crisis management and moral reckoning; a refuge
      for difficult admissions that will produce public consequences.
    symbolic_significance: Embodies the collision of private failure and institutional
      duty—an intimate space that underlines how personal faults become political
      liabilities.
    access_restrictions: Practically restricted to senior staff and confidants during
      the crisis; not open to the press or rank-and-file.
    key_environmental_details:
    - Narrow light from the corridor; muted television in the corner.
    - The smell of strong coffee and scattered briefing folders.
    - A heavy executive desk and a two-to-three seat couch framing the conversation.

    description_of_involvement: Sierra Tucson is referenced as the clinical recovery
      center Leo left; it provides critical backstory that frames questions about

      and vetting.
    observed_atmosphere: Evoke clinical, confidential medical care—an environment
      of privacy and recovery that contrasts with the public scrutiny now threatening
      to penetrate it.
    functional_role: Offstage origin for Leo's recovery history and a source of sensitivity
      about disclosure.
    symbolic_significance: Represents private rehabilitation and the stigma that can
      attach to recovery in public life.
    access_restrictions: Confidential medical facility with privacy protections; not
      open to public inquiry without consent.
    key_environmental_details:
    - Invoked as a named institution rather than depicted physically.
    - Carries connotations of fluorescent corridors, counselling rooms, and enforced

    description_of_involvement: Bolivia functions as an offhand rhetorical device
      in Leo's defensive humor—he uses it to deflate accusatory lines about selling

      security.
    observed_atmosphere: Mentioned tersely, carrying a sharp, joking edge that briefly
      cuts tension with dark humor.
    functional_role: Rhetorical escape hatch and a provocative hypothetical to test
      staff reactions to trust and security questions.
    symbolic_significance: A satirical shorthand for exile or betrayal—invoked to
      dramatize the absurdity of some accusations while acknowledging underlying fears.
    access_restrictions: Not an actual site of action here; purely rhetorical.
    key_environmental_details:
    - Used only in dialogue as a one-word image.

    functional_role: Sanctuary for private medical care and the stage for a transfer

  title: Leo's Public Confession at the Podium
  description: Carol ushers Leo into a flashbulb-lit press briefing room where he
    mounts the podium and deliberately takes control of a story poised to break. Reading
    a prepared statement, Leo admits a 1993 rehabilitation for alcohol and Valium
    and declares, plainly, "I am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict." The moment
    is a strategic, sacrificial move — a controlled vulnerability that preempts scandal,
    reshapes public perception, and signals Leo's willingness to absorb political
    damage to protect the President and the administration.

    - Keep the briefing environment controlled to limit variability during the confession.
    what_happened: Carol opens the door to the briefing room, announces that the press

  title: Toby Defends Federal Power, Burns Pushes Back (NEA Flashpoint)
  description: In a brisk hallway-to-Roosevelt Room exchange, Toby squares off with
    Congressman Burns and colleagues over the State of the Union's tone and scope.
    Burns warns that parts of the speech will leave vulnerable incumbents exposed;
    Toby answers with principled defiance, insisting the address should celebrate
    government’s capacity to act. The argument crystallizes on the N.E.A.—a small
    policy line that becomes a symbolic flashpoint—exposing intra-party divisions,
    sharpening SOTU messaging stakes, and forcing the speech team to choose between
    conviction and political caution.

  sequence_in_scene: 18
  key_dialogue:
  - 'BURNS: "Toby, I''m concerned that the speech contains a number of positions that
    democrats and Congress aren''t quite on board with yet."'
  - 'TOBY: "This is an opportunity for a pep rally. This is an opportunity to trumpet
    government. Why do we want to pretend to be sorry for intruding?"'
  - 'CONGRESSMAN: "Federal funding for the arts."'

    emotional_state: Righteously defiant with a thin veneer of impatience; calm in
      method but visibly exasperated by short‑term political calculations.
    goals:
    - Protect the President's voice and the speech's moral clarity.
    - Keep the address aspirational—use it to champion government's positive role,
      not retreat.
    - Manage time/pace of edits by inviting targeted fights he can concede or win.

      political cautions, reframes the SOTU as a pep rally, and refuses to apologize

      section by section, and anchors the meeting on principle rather than horse‑trading.'

  title: 'Unmasked: Bartlet''s MS Confession to Leo'
  description: 'In an intimate, explosive bedroom confrontation, President Josiah
    Bartlet admits to Leo McGarry that he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis seven
    years earlier and has been concealing it to protect his presidential ambitions.
    Bartlet offers clinical details—relapsing-remitting course, Betaseron injections,
    fever as a trigger—while trying to deflect with humor. Leo reacts with raw betrayal:
    not just anger at the secrecy, but grief that a deeper friendship was denied.
    The exchange fractures trust at the innermost circle and immediately re-raises
    political stakes as Charlie interrupts to announce Lord Marbury''s arrival, forcing
    private pain back into public duty.'

    description_of_involvement: The Roosevelt Room is the enclosed setting for the
      run‑through and policy sparring; its formal meeting table concentrates voices
      and makes a private policy dispute feel institutional. The room contains staff
      and visiting congressmen and frames the exchange as an inside‑the‑administration
      battleground.
    observed_atmosphere: Tension-filled and clipped; the air moves from procedural
      to electric as personal rebukes escalate, ending in stunned silence.
    functional_role: Meeting place and battleground for State‑of‑the‑Union messaging
      and intra‑party dispute.
    symbolic_significance: Embodies institutional power and the administration's internal
      conflict; the room's formality contrasts with the raw moral confrontation that
      unfolds.

      proposal.
    observed_atmosphere: Clinical and distant — the invocation brings an image of
      ordered, prosperous public policy rather than emotional debate.
    functional_role: Comparative benchmark to normalize the NEA's scale and blunt

    misattributes canonical works while arguing against N.E.A. funding. Toby''s brusque
    factual correction — naming Rodgers & Hammerstein, Arthur Miller and the WPA —
    is delivered with moral weight, then he abruptly ends the meeting. The silence

    - Expose and shame sloppy, politically motivated attacks on the arts.
    - Regain control of the messaging environment by ending the meeting on his terms.

      corrects factual errors, calls out Burns''s tone as gay‑baiting, recites authoritative

    - Language and historical accuracy matter morally and politically.

    - Bring the meeting back to controlled, narrow messaging acceptable to Congress.

    beliefs:

  title: C.J. Summons Danny — Controlling the Personal/Professional Boundary
  description: As the West Wing holds its breath before the State of the Union, private
    tensions bleed into the workplace. Josh teases C.J. about Danny flirting with

    with a smile that masks more than amusement, C.J. spots an aide and asks Carol
    to bring Danny to her office. The summons is a deliberate, controlled move — both
    a containment of staff distraction and the opening of a personal confrontation
    that will test C.J.'s professional composure.

  title: The Pound Sign That Pulls Them Out
  description: 'In a small, intimate beat in the President''s bedroom Abbey insists
    on one more temperature check; Bartlet deflects with humor and a kiss. The mood
    shifts when Abbey, reading the State of the Union, spots a glaring error — ''hallowed''
    replaced by a pound sign — a detail that yanks the private care scene outward
    toward the public arena. The moment crystallizes the episode''s pressure: Bartlet''s
    vulnerability is being managed behind closed doors even as a speech he must deliver

  title: A Quiet Test of Trust (Leo Overhears)
  description: 'Standing in his office doorway to fetch his coat, Leo pauses and listens
    as President Bartlet converts a constitutional drill into a moral test: rather
    than ask about résumé or experience, Bartlet asks Roger Tribby if he has a best
    friend who is smarter and whom he''d trust with his life — then names that person
    as chief of staff. Leo, unseen, is visibly moved and walks away, while Bartlet
    softens the moment with a mundane tip and quiet reassurance. The beat reframes
    presidential succession from procedure to personal stewardship, illuminating what
    Bartlet values and quietly implicating Leo in the heavy work of trust and consequence.'
