  title: Pre-Dawn Political Triage (2:38 A.M.)
  description: 'At 2:38 A.M. the episode opens on a taut, pre-dawn mobilization that
    crystallizes every pressure bearing down on President Jed Bartlet. Staff move
    like a well-drilled machine as political triage unfolds: scheduling fights with
    donors, contingency planning for Zoey''s safety, and last-minute calculations
    about a razor-thin Senate fight. The sequence functions as an inciting pressure-cooker
    — a turning-point setup that forces immediate tactical choices and reveals where
    Bartlet’s principles will be tested against politics, protection, and cash.'

  title: 'Bartlet''s Resolve: Politics vs. Paternal Fear'
  description: Inside the limousine en route to the airport, Bartlet and Leo trade
    weary, intimate blows that reframe a political calculation as a father's torment.
    Bartlet admits his discomfort at forcing Hoynes into a 50–50 ethanol vote while
    shifting to a raw, comic-but-urgent anxiety about Zoey's new Secret Service detail.
    Leo tries one last time to protect the President's stamina and sanity; Bartlet
    politely refuses. The exchange functions as both setup and emotional turning point,
    crystallizing Bartlet's choice to press momentum despite political and personal
    costs.

  title: Paternal Vigilance on the Road
  description: In the limousine en route to the airport, Bartlet shifts a weary political
    conversation with Leo into a raw, paternal moment about Zoey's safety. The banter—half
    joke, half threat—exposes Bartlet's need for visible protection and his refusal
    to surrender control or rest. Leo urges prudence and sleep; Bartlet rejects both,
    revealing anxiety that will drive him to interrogate Zoey's new agent later. This
    beat reframes abstract political cost as intensely personal stakes and sets up
    continuity for Bartlet's protective actions to follow.

  title: Tarmac Farewell — Bartlet's Guarded Departure
  description: On the Air Force One tarmac Bartlet and Leo exchange a brief, businesslike
    goodbye that quietly compresses decades of loyalty and responsibility into two
    sentences. Leo's steady, workmanlike send-off and Bartlet's curt reply mark a
    transition from on-the-ground crisis to the isolating ritual of travel. As C.J.
    and Charlie join him, Bartlet forces buoyant banter about "racing the sun," while
    C.J.'s dry response punctures the performance—signaling exhaustion beneath presidential
    theatricality and underscoring Leo's role as his steadying presence. This moment
    functions as a transitional beat that reveals emotional strain without spectacle.

  title: Brittle Levity on the Tarmac
  description: 'On the Air Force One tarmac, Bartlet mounts the plane while trading
    perfunctory goodbyes with Leo, then greets C.J. and Charlie with a practiced,
    exuberant patter meant to buoy an exhausted press. His “race the sun” line is
    jaunty on the surface but thinly veils fatigue and strain. C.J.’s deadpan reminder
    that the press is not in the mood at 3:00 a.m. punctures the façade, crystallizing
    a theme: the President must perform optimism even as his staff— and the media—are
    frayed. This quiet beat sets the tonal counterpoint before the flight’s political
    urgencies intensify.'

  title: Razor Margin, Kiefer's Shadow
  description: 'Onboard Air Force One the administration''s brittle equilibrium snaps
    taut: Bartlet casually announces the ethanol tax-credit is a razor-thin 50-50,
    Sam urges last-minute calls and is rebuffed by the President''s weary, managerial
    certainty. Toby and Josh push to discuss the looming Al Kiefer meeting, exposing
    the staff''s real fear — that political tactics and donor pressure may force moral
    compromise. The moment functions as a setup and tonal pivot: it crystallizes political
    stakes, foreshadows the Kiefer confrontation, and ends the teaser by reasserting

    Kiefer, then demonstrates the blunt privilege of his office: he picks up the intercom

  title: Marcus Cancels the Fundraiser — The Ultimatum
  description: At Ted Marcus's Bel Air mansion, Josh arrives to smooth over a donor
    visit and instead confronts a cold, theatrical power play. Marcus obsessively
    frames House Resolution 973 (a ban on gays in the military) as non‑negotiable
    and proves his seriousness by abruptly cancelling the President's fundraiser.
    Josh scrambles to reassure him that such a law won't pass and the President wouldn't
    sign it, but Marcus demands a public, on‑air repudiation — a moral and political
    ultimatum that raises stakes around money, votes, and presidential authority.

  description: 'Outside the conference room Bartlet calmly thwarts the staff''s urge
    to triage politics on the sidewalk. He deflects Toby''s alarm about Al Kiefer,
    sets the Kiefer encounter for lunch, and explicitly postpones Josh''s urgent Ted
    Marcus problem until they can speak in the car. With a teasing domesticism — insisting
    on guacamole and shielding Zoey''s Playa Cantina outing — Bartlet signals priorities:
    protect family and optics now, let staff handle the political pressure later.

  title: Donna's Celebrity Swerve — Josh Pulls Her Away
  description: At a glittering fundraiser, Josh physically intervenes as an intoxicated
    Donna fawns over David Hasselhoff. He drags her away, confiscates her drink and
    scolds her for frightening guests — a small, comic containment maneuver that reveals
    Josh's reluctant caretaker role and Donna's compulsive, fame-seeking restlessness.
    The beat undercuts the night's political tensions with human embarrassment, protects
    the staff's public face, and quietly foreshadows the personal costs of their exposure
    to celebrity culture and late-night temptation.

    Kenny, calls him over poolside. Their exchange is lightly flirtatious: Joey teases
    him for taking so long to say hello; Josh offers a perfunctory, work-frayed excuse

    grind and culminates in a small, meaningful vow — a thumbs-up and Josh''s plea

  description: At a crowded fundraiser by the pool, Josh and Joey share a charged,

    Joey teases Josh about not saying hello; he fumbles between charm and urgent business.
    Just as the moment warms, Toby calls Josh away. Josh, torn between duty and the
    impulse to stay, asks Joey not to leave, gives a small thumbs-up promise, and
    follows Toby. The interruption defers emotional payoff and keeps the romantic
    thread alive as a quiet counterpoint to the evening's high-stakes conflicts.

  title: Flag-Poll Reality Check and a Quiet Personal Loss
  description: On the mansion patio a political and a personal reckoning occur in
    the same breath. Joey Lucas methodically destroys Al Kiefer’s scare-poll by showing
    the flag-burning amendment is low-priority for voters, turning a donor-driven
    ‘‘opportunity’’ into a strategic liability and impressing Sam and Toby. The victory
    is undercut when Joey quietly reveals she "came here with someone," delivering
    a private emotional blow to Josh. The beat functions as both a tactical turning
    point—deflating a dangerous strategy—and a bittersweet character moment that punctures
    Josh’s hopes without drama.

  - 'JOEY: "Kiefer asked the wrong questions. His polls said that 80% of the people,
    when asked if they''d support an amendment prohibiting flag burning said yes,
    which is roughly the same amount of people that say they support sending litterbugs
    to prison. He never asked them how much they care. 37%, or less than half of those
    who said they''d favor the amendment, rated the issue fairly or very important.
    12%, or less than a third of that group, said that the issue would swing their
    vote. The only place that this war is being fought is in Washington."'
  - 'JOEY: "I came here with someone."  JOSH: "I''m... I''m sorry?"  JOEY: "I came
    here with someone."  JOSH: "Okay, um. I should go. I have to go."  JOEY: "Wait,
    will you call me some time, next time you come out here?"  JOSH: "Absolutely.
    I will call in advance of my coming."'

  title: Bartlet Refuses to Publicly Veto — Demanding Trust Over Donor Theater
  description: 'In a late-night confrontation in the mansion study, powerful donor
    Ted Marcus demands that President Bartlet publicly threaten a veto of Cameron''s
    anti-gay bill as a symbolic placation for his contributors. Bartlet refuses, arguing
    that a public pronouncement would politicize and energize the bill, and angrily
    defends Josh after Marcus'' pressure. The exchange crystallizes the central conflict
    between moral leadership and short-term donor management: Bartlet insists on strategic
    restraint and personal accountability, wins Marcus''s verbal concession, and sets
    a boundary that will shape the administration''s public posture.'

  title: Drawing the Line — Bartlet Refuses the Pose
  description: In a tense, late-night confrontation in the study, President Bartlet
    refuses donor Ted Marcus's demand that he publicly threaten a veto on an anti-gay
    bill as a symbolic gesture. Bartlet explodes — not from personal pique but from
    strategic conviction — arguing that airing the issue will politicize and damage
    the cause. Marcus, chastened, concedes and explicitly reaffirms his trust. The
    exchange ends exhausted and oddly intimate, crystallizing Bartlet's ethical boundaries,
    political discipline, and the emotional cost of leadership.

    mocks and then quietly removes his last excuses — producing a phone message with
    Joey''s room information and turning his nervous rationalizations into a fait
    accompli. Donna''s playful coercion (clucking, quasi-poetic urgings) exposes Josh''s

  description: Late at night Josh impulsively goes to Joey's hotel room, rings until
    the door opens and Al Kiefer—in a white robe—answers. Al confirms Joey is inside;
    she emerges, also in a robe, visibly shocked. Josh stammers a clumsy goodbye,
    thanking her for her help, as Al dryly translates and shuts the door. The moment
    punctures Josh's bravado and quietly exposes Joey's intimate connection to Al,
    undercutting his hopes and leaving him off-balance after a high-pressure day.
