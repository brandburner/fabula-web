  title: Tarmac Farewell — Bartlet's Guarded Departure
  description: On the Air Force One tarmac Bartlet and Leo exchange a brief, businesslike
    goodbye that quietly compresses decades of loyalty and responsibility into two
    sentences. Leo's steady, workmanlike send-off and Bartlet's curt reply mark a
    transition from on-the-ground crisis to the isolating ritual of travel. As C.J.
    and Charlie join him, Bartlet forces buoyant banter about "racing the sun," while
    C.J.'s dry response punctures the performance—signaling exhaustion beneath presidential
    theatricality and underscoring Leo's role as his steadying presence. This moment
    functions as a transitional beat that reveals emotional strain without spectacle.

  title: Brittle Levity on the Tarmac
  description: 'On the Air Force One tarmac, Bartlet mounts the plane while trading
    perfunctory goodbyes with Leo, then greets C.J. and Charlie with a practiced,
    exuberant patter meant to buoy an exhausted press. His “race the sun” line is
    jaunty on the surface but thinly veils fatigue and strain. C.J.’s deadpan reminder
    that the press is not in the mood at 3:00 a.m. punctures the façade, crystallizing
    a theme: the President must perform optimism even as his staff— and the media—are
    frayed. This quiet beat sets the tonal counterpoint before the flight’s political
    urgencies intensify.'

  title: Sunscreen Banter Snapped Back to Duty
  description: 'A moment of domestic levity between C.J. and Donna — a rapid exchange
    about SPF regimens and tanning windows — humanizes the exhausted White House team
    and briefly undercuts the day’s mounting pressure. Toby’s practical interruption
    — reminding them they’re in California for one day — yanks the group back to the
    mission. Josh then drops the political landmine: Cameron will introduce a bill
    about gays in the military. Sam, half-asleep, clarifies; Josh worries Ted Marcus
    will care. Charlie’s entrance about a man approaching the cockpit immediately
    shifts the banter into urgency. This beat functions as a tonal pivot and setup:
    intimate character color gives way to the episode’s central policy/donor conflict
    and the security/PR work that will follow.'

  title: Sunscreen Banter to Donor Whip
  description: 'A languid, humanizing moment aboard Air Force One — C.J. and Donna
    trade sunscreen tips — is abruptly converted into political focus when Josh breaks
    the small talk: a controversial bill banning gays from the military is imminent.

    the electoral and fundraising consequences: Josh worries Ted Marcus will care,
    Toby urges patience, and C.J. readies herself to intervene. The beat sets up the
    central policy-vs.-donor dilemma and foreshadows a looming donor ultimatum.'

  title: Leo Owns the Messaging Failure
  description: 'In a terse hallway exchange, Leo admits the campaign never sold the
    ethanol tax credit''s tangible benefits — ''We didn''t say it enough'' — while
    staffers Larry and Ed tally the economic facts and concede political limits. The
    admission exposes a strategic blind spot as Sam frantically phones senators from
    a plane, and Leo acknowledges their window is closing. Margaret''s quiet, personal
    moment about travel underscores the private costs of public crises. The beat functions
    as a turning point: political vulnerability becomes urgent, and Leo immediately
    mobilizes the Vice President as the team scrambles to salvage the vote.'

  title: Paternal Vigilance on the Road
  description: In the limousine en route to the airport, Bartlet shifts a weary political
    conversation with Leo into a raw, paternal moment about Zoey's safety. The banter—half
    joke, half threat—exposes Bartlet's need for visible protection and his refusal
    to surrender control or rest. Leo urges prudence and sleep; Bartlet rejects both,
    revealing anxiety that will drive him to interrogate Zoey's new agent later. This
    beat reframes abstract political cost as intensely personal stakes and sets up
    continuity for Bartlet's protective actions to follow.

  title: Midnight Ultimatum — Dump the Bill, Take the Shot at Hoynes
  description: In a private, late-night phone exchange, Bartlet erupts at Leo over
    Vice President Hoynes's maneuvering, threatening he can ask for Hoynes's resignation.
    Leo delivers a cold political correction — the administration is wrong about the
    ethanol tax credit — and Sam offers a procedural fix to spare the Vice President.
    Confronted with the tactical truth and personal exhaustion, Bartlet orders the
    bill dumped while insisting he is "not done with Hoynes," a cramped, costly compromise

  description: 'Vice President Hoynes arrives in Leo''s office expecting routine conversation
    but the tone snaps taut when Leo tells him the Senate is 50-50 and the President
    needs his tie-breaking vote on the ethanol tax credit. Leo pleads with policy
    and political numbers—16,000 jobs, $4 billion in investment—while Hoynes digs
    in on principle and self-preservation, arguing the credit failed its goals and
    he can''t be forced into a vote that will be used against him. The scene crystallizes
    a turning point: the White House''s leverage is limited, personal reputations
    are at stake, and an administrative request is now a political crisis requiring
    immediate recalibration.'

  title: 'Kiefer''s Numbers-Driven Sell: Burn the Flag, Save the White House'
  description: At a tense Los Angeles lunch, Al Kiefer delivers a hard-edged, data-first
    sales pitch urging President Bartlet to publicly back a constitutional amendment
    against flag burning as the shortcut to a locked second term. Kiefer frames opposition
    as electoral suicide, touts a specific 47% voter bloc, and insists leadership
    — not protest — will win the day. The staff reacts with disbelief and moral outrage;
    Josh is yanked away by a phone call, Toby answers with a mordant insult, and Bartlet
    abruptly exits after Charlie interrupts, leaving the choice unresolved and the
    room fractured between principle, political expediency, and team loyalty.

    lock on your second term right here, right now in this room?"'

  title: Drawing the Line — Bartlet Refuses the Pose
  description: In a tense, late-night confrontation in the study, President Bartlet
    refuses donor Ted Marcus's demand that he publicly threaten a veto on an anti-gay
    bill as a symbolic gesture. Bartlet explodes — not from personal pique but from
    strategic conviction — arguing that airing the issue will politicize and damage
    the cause. Marcus, chastened, concedes and explicitly reaffirms his trust. The
    exchange ends exhausted and oddly intimate, crystallizing Bartlet's ethical boundaries,
    political discipline, and the emotional cost of leadership.

    impulse to stay, asks Joey not to leave, gives a small thumbs-up promise, and
    follows Toby. The interruption defers emotional payoff and keeps the romantic

  title: Deferring Marcus — Bartlet Protects Zoey's Lunch
  description: 'Outside the conference room Bartlet calmly thwarts the staff''s urge
    to triage politics on the sidewalk. He deflects Toby''s alarm about Al Kiefer,
    sets the Kiefer encounter for lunch, and explicitly postpones Josh''s urgent Ted
    Marcus problem until they can speak in the car. With a teasing domesticism — insisting
    on guacamole and shielding Zoey''s Playa Cantina outing — Bartlet signals priorities:
    protect family and optics now, let staff handle the political pressure later.
    The beat both delays the Marcus confrontation and cements Bartlet''s authority
    over timing and exposure.'

    banter into razor‑sharp White House work. After a playful exchange with Jay Leno
    she pulls Sam into the orbit of staff business, joins Toby and Josh at a table,

    landing a private, bittersweet personal moment when Joey confesses, "I came here

  title: Flag-Poll Reality Check and a Quiet Personal Loss
  description: On the mansion patio a political and a personal reckoning occur in
    the same breath. Joey Lucas methodically destroys Al Kiefer’s scare-poll by showing
    the flag-burning amendment is low-priority for voters, turning a donor-driven
    ‘‘opportunity’’ into a strategic liability and impressing Sam and Toby. The victory
    is undercut when Joey quietly reveals she "came here with someone," delivering
    a private emotional blow to Josh. The beat functions as both a tactical turning
    point—deflating a dangerous strategy—and a bittersweet character moment that punctures
    Josh’s hopes without drama.

  key_dialogue:
  - 'JOEY: "Kiefer asked the wrong questions. His polls said that 80% of the people,
    when asked if they''d support an amendment prohibiting flag burning said yes,
    which is roughly the same amount of people that say they support sending litterbugs
    to prison. He never asked them how much they care. 37%, or less than half of those
    who said they''d favor the amendment, rated the issue fairly or very important.
    12%, or less than a third of that group, said that the issue would swing their
    vote. The only place that this war is being fought is in Washington."'
  - 'JOEY: "I came here with someone."  JOSH: "I''m... I''m sorry?"  JOEY: "I came
    here with someone."  JOSH: "Okay, um. I should go. I have to go."  JOEY: "Wait,
    will you call me some time, next time you come out here?"  JOSH: "Absolutely.
    I will call in advance of my coming."'
