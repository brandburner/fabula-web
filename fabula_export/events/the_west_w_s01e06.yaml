  title: Late‑Night Poker, Presidential Trivia, and Leo's Exit
  description: 'A late‑night poker game in Leo’s office doubles as a character scene:
    Bartlet toys with arcane quizzes, asserting intellectual dominance; Toby oscillates
    between irritation and bravado (raising Bartlet’s bet), and the room’s easy camaraderie
    punctures when Leo announces he’s heading home. The playful rivalry reveals loyalties,
    power dynamics, and Bartlet’s paternal tone, while the abrupt security check and
    Leo’s quiet departure turn levity into a private, uneasy beat that undercuts the
    evening and propels the team back toward urgent policy work.'

  title: Late-Night Poker, Leo's Exit, and the Commerce Report — Census Sampling Looms
  description: 'A convivial late-night poker game dissolves into policy and pressure:
    after President Bartlet toys with trivia, Leo quietly announces he''s leaving,
    shifting the mood from camaraderie to private crisis. Josh and Sam pivot immediately
    to work — the commerce report is ready and Sam promises to school Josh on ''standard
    data versus sampling'' in the census. That promise seeds the episode''s central
    legislative fight. A sudden Secret Service security alert punctures the night,
    underscoring vulnerability and raising the stakes for the team''s distracted focus.'

  title: Poker Night Interrupted by Security Alert
  description: 'A late-night, convivial poker game in Leo''s office abruptly fractures
    when Secret Service agents storm in to announce a security breach. The room''s
    easy intimacy — trivia, teasing, and offhand bets — collapses into protocol and
    taut nerves. President Bartlet reflexively restores levity with more quizzes,
    masking an anxiety beneath the humor; the agents'' terse reassurance, "We''re
    clear," lands like an uneasy punctuation. The beat functions as a setup: it ruptures
    normalcy, foreshadows a real threat to Bartlet''s family, and reveals how the
    West Wing''s coping mechanisms kick in under pressure.'

  title: Toby Demands the Constitution / C.J. Confesses She's Been Faking It
  description: Toby storms into the communications office, brusquely demanding “Article
    I, Section 2” and exposing his team’s lack of immediate constitutional grounding
    with a frustrated, almost comic tirade (Amazon, the National Archives). The outburst
    both signals Toby’s doctrinal intensity about the census fight and reveals a fragile
    operation that must be shored up. Immediately after, C.J. quietly admits to Sam
    that she’s been "faking it" on the census; Sam offers to tutor her at lunch. The
    scene functions as a tone shift — equal parts character reveal and set-up — forcing
    the communications shop to acknowledge gaps in expertise at a politically urgent
    moment.

    that crystallizes under legislative pressure. Sam moves from surprise to steady
    support, reframing her admission as solvable and scheduling a lunch tutoring session.
    The beat converts personal embarrassment into a practical fix: shore up the press
    operation’s competence on a high‑stakes issue. It’s a quiet revelation that sets
    up both comic payoff and real political risk later.'

  title: Locking Down the Census Swing Votes
  description: In Josh's bullpen the team confronts a pork‑laden Appropriations bill
    and the razor‑thin politics that could sink it. Mandy lays out a targeted plan
    to flip two Commerce swing votes — Gladman and Skinner — and to wrestle Joe Willis
    into dropping a prohibition on statistical sampling in the census. Toby's breezy
    certainty that Willis will fall in line collides with Leo's insistence on a quiet,
    mistake‑free operation. The scene establishes the tactical meeting to come, the
    real stakes (a bill that could collapse), and the ideological and interpersonal
    tensions driving the vote fight.

  title: Donna Claims Her Surplus
  description: Donna stops Josh in the bullpen to demand "her" share of the unprecedented
    budget surplus—a deceptively comic exchange that crystallizes larger tensions
    about entitlement, ownership, and political symbolism. The scene then cuts into
    Leo's office where the team scans a pork‑laden Appropriations bill and lays plans
    to neutralize three swing votes by persuading Congressman Willis to drop a sampling
    ban. Toby's confident pragmatism collides with Leo's demand for quiet, unwrecked
    execution, establishing this beat as both character color and a setup for the
    fragile legislative maneuver to come.

  title: Intruder at the North Lawn — Zoey Identified as the Target
  description: 'In the Oval Office Ron Butterfield delivers a terse security briefing:
    a mentally unstable woman tripped an external alarm and, crucially, the intruder
    was not after the President but his daughter Zoey. Leo arrives and, despite having
    a personal crisis to raise, defers in the face of the security news. Ron emphasizes
    that the security system worked, a full report will follow, and there were multiple
    checks between the breach and Zoey’s room. Bartlet masks presidential composure,
    but his final, simple question — “Did she have a gun?” — exposes the parental
    fear beneath the protocol. The scene shifts the story’s stakes from policy and
    politics to family vulnerability, setting up later confrontations and underscoring
    the cost of public life.'

  title: Josh's Reluctant Georgetown Run
  description: President Bartlet tasks Josh with taking Charlie out for a beer — a
    small paternal favor meant to give the young aide a night away from work. Josh
    accepts reluctantly, exchanging friendly barbs with Mrs. Landingham and declining
    the President's offered cash. What begins as a simple, almost comic errand escalates
    when Zoey and Mallory insist on tagging along, and Josh reluctantly agrees. The
    scene plays as a humanizing counterpoint to the Roosevelt Room's high-stakes politics,
    sets up the later Georgetown confrontation, and exposes tensions between private
    life and public duty.

  description: 'In a high‑stakes Roosevelt Room standoff, Toby and Mandy counter technical,

    pivots to history. Forcing Mandy to read Article I, Section 2, he exposes the

  description: At a crowded Georgetown bar the White House crew trade teasing, exposing
    private truths — Sam's embarrassed confession about a call girl and Zoey discreetly
    hands Josh her panic button, a small token that signals her vulnerability and
    trust. Charlie admits his insecurity about not going to college, humanizing him,
    before three men harass Zoey. Charlie intervenes, is taunted with slurs, and Sam
    and Josh back him up until Secret Service arrives to remove the harassers. The
    beat crystallizes team loyalty, the personal cost of public life, and seeds security
    stakes that will escalate later.

  description: After the Georgetown bar incident, President Bartlet confronts his
    daughter Zoey in the Mural Room. His questions move from anger to raw fear as
    he delivers a harrowing kidnapping scenario to explain why her outings cannot
    be treated as ordinary. Zoey resists—insisting on normalcy and autonomy—but is
    forced to accept stepped-up Secret Service protection when Bartlet reframes freedom
    as a negotiated privilege. The scene crystallizes the personal cost of public

    comes up from behind, puts their hand across your mouth, and whisks you out the
    back door. You''re so petrified, you don''t even notice the bodies of two secret
    service agents lying on the ground with bullet holes in their heads. Then you''re
    whisked away in a car. It''s a big party with lots of noise, and lots of people
    coming and going. And it''s a half hour before someone says, ''Hey where''s Zoey?''
    Another 15 minutes before the first phone call. Another hour and a half before
    anyone even THINKS to shut down all the airports. Now we''re off to the races.
    You''re tied to a chair in a cargo shack, somewhere in the middle of Uganda. And
    I''m told that I have 72 hours to get Israel to free 460 terrorist prisoners.
    So I''m on the phone pleading with Benjamin and he''s saying, ''I''m sorry Mr.
    President, but Israel simply does not negotiate with terrorists, period. It''s
    the only way we can survive.'' So now we''ve got a new problem, because this country
    no longer has a commander in chief, it has a father who''s out of his mind because
    his little girl is in a shack somewhere in Uganda with a gun to her head. DO YOU
    GET IT?!"'
