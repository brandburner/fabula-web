  title: Morning Status Ritual — Command and Confirmation
  description: 'John Smith makes a controlled, authoritative entrance, delivering
    a broad, inclusive greeting that reasserts his place atop the office hierarchy.
    Mary’s brief, گرم acknowledgement anchors him socially while the Secretary’s quiet
    act of bringing coffee formalizes the ritual: a ceremonial bestowal of service
    that both comforts and obligates. This short exchange functions as a setup—ritual
    reinforcement of John’s professional identity and a subtle prep for the public
    test he’s about to face at the board presentation.'

  title: 'Threshold: The Quiet Exit'
  description: John pauses in the parking lot, meeting Mary for a brief, charged exchange
    before he slips away to a downtown, high‑stakes presentation. His terse answer
    masks pressure and a need to control perception; Mary's casual question both grounds
    him in workplace ties and catalyzes his disclosure. From the window the Secretary’s
    small wave functions as a ritual farewell — a symbolic crossing from the familiar
    rituals of the office into public scrutiny and the real test of the boardroom.

  title: 'Boardroom Triumph: John''s Quarterly Presentation'
  description: 'John Smith takes the room with a quiet, authoritative presentation
    of the quarterly results. He asserts control—measured, unflappable—while Mary
    Jones records every figure, her attentive note-taking converting into a single,
    decisive validation. Her line, spoken after his rundown, crystallizes the scene
    as a professional victory under public scrutiny. The exchange functions as a turning
    point: an earned affirmation that secures John''s standing and thematically mirrors
    his earlier assertion of authority, the moment sealed as the scene cuts to black.'
