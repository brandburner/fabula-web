  title: Pre-Dawn Political Triage (2:38 A.M.)
  description: 'At 2:38 A.M. the episode opens on a taut, pre-dawn mobilization that
    crystallizes every pressure bearing down on President Jed Bartlet. Staff move
    like a well-drilled machine as political triage unfolds: scheduling fights with
    donors, contingency planning for Zoey''s safety, and last-minute calculations
    about a razor-thin Senate fight. The sequence functions as an inciting pressure-cooker
    — a turning-point setup that forces immediate tactical choices and reveals where
    Bartlet’s principles will be tested against politics, protection, and cash.'

  title: 'Bartlet''s Resolve: Politics vs. Paternal Fear'
  description: Inside the limousine en route to the airport, Bartlet and Leo trade
    weary, intimate blows that reframe a political calculation as a father's torment.
    Bartlet admits his discomfort at forcing Hoynes into a 50–50 ethanol vote while
    shifting to a raw, comic-but-urgent anxiety about Zoey's new Secret Service detail.
    Leo tries one last time to protect the President's stamina and sanity; Bartlet
    politely refuses. The exchange functions as both setup and emotional turning point,
    crystallizing Bartlet's choice to press momentum despite political and personal
    costs.

  title: Paternal Vigilance on the Road
  description: In the limousine en route to the airport, Bartlet shifts a weary political
    conversation with Leo into a raw, paternal moment about Zoey's safety. The banter—half
    joke, half threat—exposes Bartlet's need for visible protection and his refusal
    to surrender control or rest. Leo urges prudence and sleep; Bartlet rejects both,
    revealing anxiety that will drive him to interrogate Zoey's new agent later. This
    beat reframes abstract political cost as intensely personal stakes and sets up
    continuity for Bartlet's protective actions to follow.

    what_happened: Bartlet steers a conversational shift from political irony to a
      possessive, protective monologue about his daughter’s safety, naming the new
      detail and rejecting Leo's advice to rest; he uses humor as aggression and refuses

  title: Tarmac Farewell — Bartlet's Guarded Departure
  description: On the Air Force One tarmac Bartlet and Leo exchange a brief, businesslike
    goodbye that quietly compresses decades of loyalty and responsibility into two
    sentences. Leo's steady, workmanlike send-off and Bartlet's curt reply mark a
    transition from on-the-ground crisis to the isolating ritual of travel. As C.J.
    and Charlie join him, Bartlet forces buoyant banter about "racing the sun," while
    C.J.'s dry response punctures the performance—signaling exhaustion beneath presidential
    theatricality and underscoring Leo's role as his steadying presence. This moment
    functions as a transitional beat that reveals emotional strain without spectacle.

  title: Razor Margin, Kiefer's Shadow
  description: 'Onboard Air Force One the administration''s brittle equilibrium snaps
    taut: Bartlet casually announces the ethanol tax-credit is a razor-thin 50-50,
    Sam urges last-minute calls and is rebuffed by the President''s weary, managerial
    certainty. Toby and Josh push to discuss the looming Al Kiefer meeting, exposing
    the staff''s real fear — that political tactics and donor pressure may force moral
    compromise. The moment functions as a setup and tonal pivot: it crystallizes political

  title: Bartlet Insists on Lunch with Kiefer — Joins Zoey at Playa Cantina
  description: Outside the conference room Bartlet shrugs off staff alarm about a
    manufactured flag-desecration crisis and refuses Toby's suggestion to cancel a
    meeting with consultant Al Kiefer. He turns the decision into his own — insisting
    the meeting happen over lunch — and, when he learns Zoey is at the Playa Cantina,
    volunteers to join her. The beat both undercuts cautious staff counsel and sets
    up a collision of politics and family exposure while Bartlet juggles donor pressure,
    security, and paternal impulse.

  title: Guacamole, Guard Detail and a Flag Joke
  description: Over an over‑protected father‑daughter lunch, Zoey complains that Secret
    Service has stripped the Los Angeles atmosphere from her meal while Bartlet deflects
    with wry humor — riffing through smog, shootings, mudslides and an offhand line
    about a “mad rash of flag burning.” Across the room Al Kiefer turns that throwaway
    joke into a political leverage pitch, pressing the President to embrace a flag‑burning
    amendment as an electoral lock. The beat sets up the moral/political conflict,
    reveals Bartlet’s habit of cloaking tension in wit, and hands the staff a problem
    that will force priorities and principles to collide.

  title: 'Kiefer''s Numbers-Driven Sell: Burn the Flag, Save the White House'
  description: At a tense Los Angeles lunch, Al Kiefer delivers a hard-edged, data-first
    sales pitch urging President Bartlet to publicly back a constitutional amendment

    as electoral suicide, touts a specific 47% voter bloc, and insists leadership
    — not protest — will win the day. The staff reacts with disbelief and moral outrage;
    Josh is yanked away by a phone call, Toby answers with a mordant insult, and Bartlet
    abruptly exits after Charlie interrupts, leaving the choice unresolved and the

  title: Shielding Zoey — Gina's Quiet Intervention
  description: After a public lunch where Zoey pleads for a fragment of normalcy,
    Gina spots two skinhead onlookers and instantly converts routine exit into a security
    maneuver. She directs Zoey to walk on her blind side, places a hand on her gun,
    shepherds her into the car and gives a single roof knock — a silent, professional
    signal that the protective perimeter has closed. The beat both raises the immediate
    threat level and cements Gina as the daughter’s vigilant safeguard, underscoring
    Zoey's vulnerability and the human cost of life in the presidential orbit.

  title: Interrupted Moment — A Thumbs-Up Promise
  description: At a crowded fundraiser by the pool, Josh and Joey share a charged,
    playful exchange — a rare, private beat in a night dominated by political pressures.
    Joey teases Josh about not saying hello; he fumbles between charm and urgent business.
    Just as the moment warms, Toby calls Josh away. Josh, torn between duty and the
    impulse to stay, asks Joey not to leave, gives a small thumbs-up promise, and
    follows Toby. The interruption defers emotional payoff and keeps the romantic
    thread alive as a quiet counterpoint to the evening's high-stakes conflicts.

  title: C.J. Smooths Jay Leno, Then Returns to Business
  description: On the mansion patio C.J. intercepts Jay Leno to privately thank him
    for holding his fire about Leo and the administration. Their banter — Jay joking
    that presidential mishaps are his "bread and butter" and C.J.'s half-joking offer
    of a favor — deliberately defuses the evening's political edge and displays C.J.'s
    practiced media diplomacy. The moment ends as C.J. spots Sam and abruptly pivots
    back into work, the easy exchange functioning as both character revelation and
    a transitional beat that returns the scene to campaign strategy.

  description: At a mansion patio party C.J. moves the evening from light celebrity
    banter into razor‑sharp White House work. After a playful exchange with Jay Leno
    she pulls Sam into the orbit of staff business, joins Toby and Josh at a table,
    and listens as pollster Joey Lucas punctures Kiefer’s case — most people say they
    favor a flag‑burning amendment in the abstract, but few consider it vote‑deciding.
    The beat pivots tone, transforming social levity into urgent strategy while also
    landing a private, bittersweet personal moment when Joey confesses, "I came here

  title: Drawing the Line — Bartlet Refuses the Pose
  description: In a tense, late-night confrontation in the study, President Bartlet
    refuses donor Ted Marcus's demand that he publicly threaten a veto on an anti-gay
    bill as a symbolic gesture. Bartlet explodes — not from personal pique but from
    strategic conviction — arguing that airing the issue will politicize and damage
    the cause. Marcus, chastened, concedes and explicitly reaffirms his trust. The
    exchange ends exhausted and oddly intimate, crystallizing Bartlet's ethical boundaries,
    political discipline, and the emotional cost of leadership.
