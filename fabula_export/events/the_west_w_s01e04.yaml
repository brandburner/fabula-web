  title: Triumph on Stage, Crisis Backstage
  description: 'President Bartlet delivers a rousing, mobilizing speech celebrating
    the gun-control push while the ballroom erupts in applause. Offstage, Leo learns
    — to his horror — that five crucial votes have defected. The celebration instantly
    flips to crisis: Josh demands names and mobilizes the staff, C.J. scrambles, Toby''s
    perfectionism surfaces in sour critique while Sam offers effusive praise, and
    Bartlet''s small, defiant gesture of pocketing his back medicine underscores his
    personal stubbornness. This beat is a turning point: public victory becomes the
    flashpoint for an all-hands political scramble that will drive the season''s high-stakes,
    costly campaign and expose personal fault lines.'

  title: No Hoynes — The 72‑Hour Pitch and Leo's Exit
  description: 'In a late‑night Roosevelt Room huddle—Chinese food, tuxes and frayed
    nerves—the senior staff discovers two unexpectedly flipped votes and Leo declares
    a 72‑hour fight to save the President''s gun‑control bill. They quickly pivot
    to clandestine tactics (play up financial disclosures as human‑interest distraction)
    and Sam tentatively proposes calling in the Vice President to sway Tillinghouse.
    Leo''s instantaneous, principled refusal (‘No way’) and abrupt departure converts
    the policy brainstorm into a revealing character beat: his political instincts
    are unyielding but personally isolating, setting up the private fallout to follow.'

  description: Leo arrives home exhausted in the middle of the night and is met by
    Jenny’s blunt, wounded frustration. He explains, matter-of-factly, that the President’s
    gun-control bill (802) is five votes short and requires immediate, all-night damage
    control. Jenny’s exasperation and the quiet revelation of an anniversary watch
    she bought underline that Leo’s devotion to the job has real, personal costs.
    The scene functions as a quiet turning point—public crisis bleeding into private
    collapse, foreshadowing the marriage’s rupture.

  description: 'Leo arrives home in the small hours, exhausted and defensive, and
    is met by Jenny''s quiet, cutting disappointment. When he blurts that the President
    is five votes short on bill 802, she frames his all-night loyalty as the recurring
    betrayal it is. A wristwatch on the table — Jenny''s anniversary gift — crystallizes
    his failure to be present: she has given up making a scene, instead withdrawing
    with weary resignation and leaving their marriage unresolved. This is a turning
    point that makes the personal cost of Leo''s political life painfully tangible.'

  title: Leela Forces Toby to Confront a Suspicious Stock Windfall
  description: In Toby's office Leela from White House Counsel interrogates Toby about
    a single, explosive stock position that jumped from $5,000 to $125,000 immediately
    after his friend Theodore McGregor testified. As Leela lays out the timing and
    legal stakes — including a 71% one-day surge tied to McGregor's testimony — Toby
    alternates between denial, humiliation and fury. Carol's brief interruption to
    announce recovered votes defuses the legislative crisis but leaves Toby exposed
    to a looming insider‑trading inquiry, turning a political victory into a personal
    legal threat and setting up the administration's next scramble.
