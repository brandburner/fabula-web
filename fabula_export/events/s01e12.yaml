  title: Shattered Pitcher — The President Collapses
  description: During a late-night State of the Union run-through, President Bartlet's
    practiced composure frays under fever and exhaustion. Small misreads and teleprompter
    typos spark nervous corrections and wry deflection; staffers watch him pale and
    sweating, realizing his body may be failing the public persona. Bartlet retreats
    to the Oval to 'take the pills' and, moments later, collapses beside a broken
    Steuben pitcher. The Secret Service's terse "Liberty's down" detonates private
    vulnerability into an immediate national emergency, converting concealment into
    a decisive turning point that will force medical disclosure and crisis management.

  title: 'Denial in the Oval: Bartlet''s Collapse Exposed'
  description: During a late-night State of the Union run-through, President Bartlet’s
    practiced humor and deflection crack into visible illness. Josh and C.J., watching
    on a monitor, press him in the hallway as he dismisses sweating, pallor and missed
    lines with jokes about pills. Their nervous banter slides into urgent concern;
    Bartlet insists he’s fine and promises to take his pills. Moments later a glass
    pitcher shatters and he lies unconscious—an offhand Secret Service call, “Liberty’s
    down,” converts a private medical emergency into an immediate national crisis
    and narrative turning point.

  title: 'Mandy Announces: Leo''s Scandal Will Break Tomorrow'
  description: 'A private, flirtatious moment in C.J.''s office snaps into a political
    emergency when Mandy bluntly tells C.J. that Leo''s story will ''break tomorrow''
    and that it''s already on the Internet. C.J.''s practiced dryness gives way to
    immediate action—she absorbs the implication (an administration-wide crisis),
    cuts the small talk, and leaves to confront Leo. The beat transforms interpersonal
    tension into a turning-point: a looming public scandal that will force damage
    control and reshape the day''s already precarious agenda.'

    beliefs:
    - A leak about Leo is a direct threat to administration stability and must be
      handled immediately.
    - Swift, private action is preferable to public chaos; staff must be mobilized
      before the story spreads further.

    - Contain the story before it morphs into a broader crisis.
    what_happened: Leo is not physically present in the scene but is the subject of

  title: Abbey Takes Charge — Private Illness Meets Public Crisis
  description: 'Abbey arrives in the President''s bedroom and immediately converts
    intimacy into clinical command: she reads his vitals, orders an IV and Flumadine,
    and administers an injection while Jed Bartlet keeps trying to manage crises by
    conversation and flirtation. Their banter reveals a long history of similar episodes;
    Abbey''s practiced sternness cracks into private anguish as she watches him sleep.
    The scene is a turning point — a private medical emergency that exposes a recurring,
    concealed vulnerability and threatens the President''s ability to lead amid rising

  title: Designated Survivor & Sam's Reckless Statement
  description: 'In a brisk hallway exchange Josh and Donna cold‑assign Roger Tribby
    — the obscure Secretary of Agriculture — as the ''designated survivor,'' a wry,
    chilling ritual that underlines the very real vulnerability around the State of
    the Union. Josh''s casualness masks anxiety; Donna''s dark humor names the logistical
    absurdity of contingency planning. Moments later Josh confronts Sam about an unauthorized,
    public statement defending Leo: Sam''s stubborn loyalty and reckless indifference
    set up immediate political fallout while Toby simultaneously spars with Congress
    over the speech''s federalist pitch, exposing ideological fault lines before the
    President speaks.'

  title: Toby Defends Federal Power, Burns Pushes Back (NEA Flashpoint)
  description: In a brisk hallway-to-Roosevelt Room exchange, Toby squares off with
    Congressman Burns and colleagues over the State of the Union's tone and scope.
    Burns warns that parts of the speech will leave vulnerable incumbents exposed;
    Toby answers with principled defiance, insisting the address should celebrate
    government’s capacity to act. The argument crystallizes on the N.E.A.—a small
    policy line that becomes a symbolic flashpoint—exposing intra-party divisions,
    sharpening SOTU messaging stakes, and forcing the speech team to choose between

  title: Roosevelt Room NEA Showdown — Toby Calls Out Burns
  description: A short, combustible policy meeting erupts into a culture‑war confrontation
    when Congressman Burns attacks the President's proposed 50% NEA increase. Toby
    answers with dry fiscal perspective and international comparison, then rebukes
    Burns' implicit moralizing about Mapplethorpe by calling him out — “You gay bashing,
    Raymond?” A visiting congressman's comic misattributions let Toby correct history
    (and claim the moral high ground), but Toby's abrupt shutdown of the meeting leaves
    the room stunned and plants a political liability that threatens the President's
    unified State‑of‑the‑Union message.

  title: C.J. Summons Danny — Controlling the Personal/Professional Boundary
  description: As the West Wing holds its breath before the State of the Union, private
    tensions bleed into the workplace. Josh teases C.J. about Danny flirting with
    Mandy; Sam is left bewildered after Mallory unexpectedly kisses him. Quietly,
    with a smile that masks more than amusement, C.J. spots an aide and asks Carol
    to bring Danny to her office. The summons is a deliberate, controlled move — both
    a containment of staff distraction and the opening of a personal confrontation
    that will test C.J.'s professional composure.

  description: 'C.J. deliberately stages a quick, pragmatic kiss with Danny in her
    office at night to purge a distracting attraction and reclaim professional focus.
    Their banter — light, self-aware and slightly defensive — reveals mutual desire
    beneath the façade of workplace decorum. Gail the fish functions as a comic, domestic
    buffer; the abrupt, passionate grab and the shaky, smiling exit that follows turn
    private longing into a public risk. This is a payoff of long-simmering tension
    and a small turning point: rules are bent, boundaries probed, and the possibility
    of future complications in the White House workspace is planted.'

  title: A Quiet Test of Trust (Leo Overhears)
  description: 'Standing in his office doorway to fetch his coat, Leo pauses and listens
    as President Bartlet converts a constitutional drill into a moral test: rather
    than ask about résumé or experience, Bartlet asks Roger Tribby if he has a best
    friend who is smarter and whom he''d trust with his life — then names that person
    as chief of staff. Leo, unseen, is visibly moved and walks away, while Bartlet
    softens the moment with a mundane tip and quiet reassurance. The beat reframes
    presidential succession from procedure to personal stewardship, illuminating what
    Bartlet values and quietly implicating Leo in the heavy work of trust and consequence.'

  title: Practical Succession — Bartlet's Quiet Hand-off
  description: 'President Bartlet reduces the enormity of the presidency to a human,
    practical lesson: how to use the Oval bathroom handle — and then tests Roger''s
    sense of loyalty by asking who he''d trust with his life. Leo, in the doorway
    getting his coat, overhears and is visibly moved. With Charlie present Bartlet
    offers a low-key reassurance before departing. Left alone beneath the seal, Tribby
    absorbs the intimacy and weight of possibility: the abstract idea of command becomes
    a personal, terrifying inheritance. This is a small, intimate turning point about
