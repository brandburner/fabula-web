  title: 'Micronesia: A Promotion That Is an Exile'
  description: 'Toby delivers a cold, formal payoff — presenting Henry Kassenbach
    with a congratulatory ''promotion'' to ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia.
    The brief, polite exchange is a surgical political move: a face‑saving diplomatic
    reassignment designed to remove a loyal FEC commissioner and clear the path for
    the administration''s campaign‑finance maneuvering. Henry''s baffled, clipped
    responses underline the personal cost of White House strategy; the beat functions
    as a turning point and the enactment of a previously negotiated, ruthless trade.'

  title: Late-Night Call — Sam Reaches, Laurie Lowers Guard
  description: 'Sam breaks his solitude with a late-night call to Laurie, finding
    her alone in the law library the night before graduation. Laurie exposes a rare,
    self-deprecating vulnerability about law school that momentarily collapses their
    formal distance and creates an intimate, protective beat between them. Sam''s
    easy dismissal — "Nobody does" — is both comforting and a pivot: the mood tightens
    as he prepares to shift from small talk to a heavier, consequential disclosure
    that ties their private tenderness to the administration''s political risk. This
    scene is a quiet turning point that humanizes Laurie and raises the stakes for
    Sam.'

  title: Launching the Poll — Wording, Timing, and a Risky Bet
  description: In a pressure-cooker bullpen at 7:05 p.m., the communications team
    erupts over semantic quibbles and clock time while a higher-stakes decision simmers.
    Toby rails about the asymmetry of question six and Josh nitpicks language; Donna
    keeps the countdown honest. C.J. refuses to let technical scruples block action
    — insisting they must hit the media window and privately betting the numbers will
    rise — directly contradicting the President. Leo cuts off the debate and orders
    the phone banks live, transforming argument into an irreversible political gamble
    and catalyzing consequences for both messaging and careers.

  title: Levity, Then the Quiet Confrontation — C.J. Calls Out Leo on the Poll
  description: Margaret breaks a tense night with an absurd egg joke, briefly defusing
    the room before ushering C.J. in. C.J. announces the poll 'lid' and, almost sotto
    voce, confronts Leo about his telling the President that everyone predicted the
    race would hold at 42 — when her take had been +5. Leo reframes it as an innocuous
    average and tells her not to read too much into it. The beat pivots from comic
    relief to a charged, gendered undermining that primes C.J. to reclaim control
    by personally checking the phone banks.

  title: C.J. Confronts Leo Over the Poll
  description: 'Margaret''s offhand egg joke briefly lightens Leo''s office before
    C.J. arrives and forces a quiet, high-stakes confrontation: she tells Leo the
    President was given a different polling prediction than hers. The exchange exposes
    C.J.''s professional vulnerability and Leo''s steady, minimising tactic — a flippant
    sports-metaphor and a curt ''don''t read too much into it'' that undercuts her
    authority. The scene functions as a turning point in the episode: it both signals
    internal fractures over the poll and pushes C.J. into private, corrective action

    President breaks the tension with an intimate, oddly domestic exchange about a
    briefcase Sam bought — a small, human detail that exposes Sam''s private vulnerability

    bargaining to the personal costs carried by staffers, then snaps back to work

  title: Leo Bursts In — C.J. Reveals Mirror's Setup
  description: 'C.J. is mid-triage on a market detail when Leo storms into her office
    demanding to know why he wasn''t told about Sam and Laurie. Under pressure she
    lays out a careful timeline: Sam called, she investigated all night, confirmed
    a photo exists, and traced it to the London Daily Mirror, which allegedly paid
    a waitress $50,000 to fabricate evidence and label Laurie a call girl. Leo presses
    on timing; C.J. admits the story runs later that day. The exchange functions as
    a turning point — a narrow political reprieve born of hard work, but it crystallizes
    the administration''s vulnerability and sets up immediate damage control and moral
    choices about protecting staff.'

    with a Theodore Roosevelt quotation as if it were political strategy — is cut

    by claiming he''s ''in charge of morale,'' uses self‑deprecating humor, and exits

    into a public leverage play. He summons a dress Marine to unsettle Barry Haskell,
    then calmly reads Barry's own anonymous quotes exposing his sympathy for a soft‑money
    ban. Leo reframes those off‑the‑record comments as proof of allegiance, escorts
    a rattled Barry into the Oval to meet President Bartlet and his cabinet, and makes
    clear this is now a political play tied to live poll numbers — converting private

  title: Oval Pressure Play — Polls as Leverage
  description: 'Leo stages a carefully theatrical interrogation of FEC Commissioner
    Barry Haskel, using the West Wing’s trappings — a drill from a dress Marine, the
    Oval itself, and casual cordiality from the President and Cabinet — to convert
    private sympathy into public leverage. Leo outed Barry with old anonymous quotes,
    frames him as already aligned, and offers the White House’s welcome as both comfort
    and coercion. Bartlet and Leo reveal this is a numbers game: the administration’s
    ability to force reform hinges on a poll just in the field, turning persuasion
    into a tactical wait for public opinion. The scene functions as a turning point:
    policy depends less on argument than on timing and optics, and Barry’s personal
    embarrassment becomes a political asset or liability depending on the incoming
