  title: 'Game Point: Bartlet''s Ringer and Toby''s Humiliation'
  description: On a nighttime pickup game outside the White House, Bartlet refuses
    to yield despite looking winded and, to everyone's surprise, brings in Mr. Rodney
    Grant — a federal employee who used to play at Duke — as a brazen ringer. Toby
    seizes momentum and taunts the President with a theatrical warning about legacy,
    only to have his shot spectacularly blocked by Grant. The public humiliation exposes
    Bartlet's competitive cunning, Toby's brittle insecurity, and the staff's reluctance
    to directly confront the President, shifting emotional power within the group.

  title: Bartlet's Ringer — Toby Publicly Blocked
  description: 'At a late-night White House pickup game President Bartlet brazenly
    substitutes in Rodney Grant — presented as a federal employee but revealed by
    Toby to be a former Duke player — as a ringer. Toby taunts the President about
    cheating and claims the moral high ground, only to have Grant spectacularly block
    his game-winning shot. The moment is played as equal parts prank and power move:
    Bartlet''s competitive, paternal cruelty is exposed, Toby is publicly humiliated
    and shaken, and the emotional balance among staff tilts toward Bartlet''s mischievous
    authority. The beat sets up Toby''s simmering insecurity and underscores Bartlet''s
    willingness to manipulate allies for sport, making this both a character moment
    and an inciting interpersonal shift.'

  title: The Smallpox Article — A Quiet Catalyst
  description: 'In Josh''s bullpen corridor a familiar, light-hearted exchange with
    Donna establishes his routines and vulnerabilities before C.J. barges in with
    a New Yorker piece about smallpox. The interruption is small but precise: an informational
    pinprick that converts into existential dread. The setup (Donna''s note that Josh
    must meet NSC''s Lacey) plus C.J.''s insistence on the article primes Josh for
    a later, harsher delivery (Lacey''s green evacuation card). Practically and emotionally,
    the moment converts workplace banter into the opening of a moral choice — protect
    his chosen family or accept secret protection — and reawakens buried trauma that
    will drive his behavior throughout the episode.'

  title: The Smallpox Article — A Quiet Catalyst
  description: 'In Josh''s bullpen corridor a familiar, light-hearted exchange with
    Donna establishes his routines and vulnerabilities before C.J. barges in with
    a New Yorker piece about smallpox. The interruption is small but precise: an informational
    pinprick that converts into existential dread. The setup (Donna''s note that Josh
    must meet NSC''s Lacey) plus C.J.''s insistence on the article primes Josh for
    a later, harsher delivery (Lacey''s green evacuation card). Practically and emotionally,
    the moment converts workplace banter into the opening of a moral choice — protect
    his chosen family or accept secret protection — and reawakens buried trauma that
    will drive his behavior throughout the episode.'

  title: Sidetracked Rehearsal — Bartlet's Deflection and Josh's Withdrawal
  description: 'During a tense press‑prep in the Briefing Room the President repeatedly
    derails the run‑through: Bartlet lapses into professorial, sarcastic answers while
    Mandy bluntly shames his tone, Leo obsessively protects trivial ''cheese day''
    commitments and Toby pushes a weapons run‑through only to be cut down by Bartlet''s
    flippant dismissal. The rehearsal fractures into bickering and ritual, and just
    outside the room Josh stands oddly withdrawn — a private silence that reframes
    the noise as a setup for a larger crisis and exposes cracks in staff authority

  title: Josh Frozen Outside the Briefing
  description: While the senior staff noisily rehearse a tense exchange between Bartlet
    and Toby, C.J. finds Josh standing outside the briefing room, staring into space.
    The brief, quiet exchange—her noticing him, his distracted, one-word replies,
    and her insistence that he come in—turns a background moment into an emotional
    hinge. It exposes Josh’s sudden withdrawal and foreshadows a deeper conflict between
    his private trauma and the public duty and loyalties he will soon be forced to
    choose between. This is a private setup that reframes the room’s chaos as pressure
    that will crack him open.

  title: C.J. Quietly Backs Posner — Toby's Opposition Looms
  description: 'In a brisk hallway exchange, Mandy corners C.J. to lock down support
    for Larry Posner''s California fundraiser. Mandy''s pragmatic urgency — she’s
    ''shoring up support'' against anticipated internal opposition — meets C.J.''s
    cool, economy-of-words politics. C.J.''s terse "I''m in" both resolves Mandy''s
    tactical need and signals a staff split with Toby, while the Roberto Benigni anecdote
    undercuts the moment with character and camaraderie. Functionally this scene is
    a setup: it cements alliances, exposes fault lines, and foreshadows the political
    and personal fallout of the Posner decision.'

  title: Hollywood Fundraiser Moral Standoff
  description: A Roosevelt Room meeting careens from fiscal seriousness into a domestic
    beat — Zoey's visit and Bartlet's announced chili night — before Mandy proposes
    a Hollywood fundraiser and Toby erupts. He frames the fundraiser as moral hypocrisy
    beside an upcoming presidential admonition to the entertainment industry, provoking
    a tense Bartlet–Toby stare‑down that Leo abruptly ends. In the hallway after the
    meeting, Josh's furtive questioning about an N.S.C. "evacuation" card hints at
    a private, trauma‑laden isolation that will complicate loyalties and escalate
    the episode's stakes.

  title: Hollywood Fundraiser Moral Standoff
  description: A Roosevelt Room meeting careens from fiscal seriousness into a domestic
    beat — Zoey's visit and Bartlet's announced chili night — before Mandy proposes
    a Hollywood fundraiser and Toby erupts. He frames the fundraiser as moral hypocrisy
    beside an upcoming presidential admonition to the entertainment industry, provoking
    a tense Bartlet–Toby stare‑down that Leo abruptly ends. In the hallway after the
    meeting, Josh's furtive questioning about an N.S.C. "evacuation" card hints at
    a private, trauma‑laden isolation that will complicate loyalties and escalate
    the episode's stakes.

  title: Pluie Pitch — Wolves-Only Roadway vs. Political Reality
  description: In the Roosevelt Room a conservation group stages a theatrical pitch,
    projecting images of Pluie the wolf to argue for an 1,800-mile, wolves-only roadway
    from Yellowstone to the Yukon. C.J. greets the spectacle with wry skepticism,
    trading jokes and practical barbs about ranchers, road signs and voter realities.
    The tone flips when the group reveals Pluie was recently shot by a rancher; C.J.
    uses the opening to ask the one brutal question politics answers — the price —
    and immediately rejects the $900 million proposal, proposing schools instead.
    The beat dramatizes idealism colliding with electoral pragmatism, showcases C.J.'s
    instincts and reframes advocacy as a political problem rather than a purely moral
    one.

  title: Mandy's Disarming Compliment
  description: 'Mandy knocks on Toby''s office and deliberately softens the political
    sparring: she approaches to parry conflict over Posner and offers an unexpected
    compliment — that Toby is better than David Rosen. Toby answers with sarcastic
    deflection, keeping emotional distance, but Mandy''s praise lands on a raw nerve.
    The beat functions as a small turning point: it defuses immediate friction, exposes
    Toby''s insecurity about being second‑choice, and subtly reorients their dynamic
    from adversarial to grudgingly respectful, setting up possible cooperation while
    revealing character vulnerability.'

      he admits that Joanie died in a house fire while babysitting him.

  title: C.J. Pulls Josh Back from the Edge
  description: Late at night Josh sits with Schubert's 'Ave Maria,' lost in a private
    panic. C.J. barges in with wine and a blunt, human remedy — chili and company
    — after Josh confesses that an N.S.C. officer handed him an evacuation card that
    excludes the staff. Josh answers with a terrifying, expert monologue about smallpox
    and societal collapse. C.J.'s pragmatic humor and insistence briefly pierce his
    retreat, offering belonging; he promises to join them but remains alone, staring
    at the closed doorway. The beat exposes Josh's exclusion anxiety, raises the epidemic
    stakes, and sets up his looming loyalty choice.

    indexes the familial warmth and mischievous rapport that holds the staff together.
    The tone shifts when Toby, unsettled by perceived distance, asks whether Bartlet
    ever preferred David Rosen for his job. Bartlet admits it candidly but follows
    with an unvarnished, paternal affirmation of Toby’s indispensability. The small,
    intimate beats humanize the President, defuse tension, and crystallize loyalties
    that matter as the night’s larger anxieties gather.

  title: Kitchen Startle and Protocoled Play
  description: In the Residence kitchen Josh sneaks up on Zoey while she cooks chili,
    producing a quick, domestic moment that reveals the staff's easy affection and
    unofficial family bonds. The playful startle and banter expose Josh's protective,
    teasing role; Zoey's casual authority and mischief; and Charlie's awkward deference
    as he meets the President's daughter. What feels like light levity also clarifies
    stakes—these are people Josh will want to protect—while gently undercutting White
    House protocol (calling Zoey 'ma'am', forbidden cumin) and forging a new, conspiratorial
    rapport between Zoey and Charlie.

  title: Josh Refuses the Evacuation Card — Choosing Staff Over Protection
  description: 'In the Residence at night, after lighthearted conversation and a family-style
    toast, Josh produces the green evacuation card he''s been carrying and refuses
    it publicly. Faced with the symbolic offer of privileged protection, he calls
    it a "white flag of surrender," explaining that he will not trade looking his
    colleagues in the eye for safety. The moment crystallizes Josh''s buried trauma
    and his moral choice to stand with his chosen family—an act that both rejects
    special treatment and tightens group loyalty as the threat of smallpox hangs over
    the White House. Bartlet''s paternal pride and the staff''s communal warmth transform
    the refusal into a turning point: a personal sacrifice that deepens the emotional
    stakes and affirms the theme of loyalty to friends over personal preservation.'

  title: Josh Refuses the Evacuation Card — Choosing Staff Over Protection
  description: 'In the Residence at night, after lighthearted conversation and a family-style
    toast, Josh produces the green evacuation card he''s been carrying and refuses
    it publicly. Faced with the symbolic offer of privileged protection, he calls
    it a "white flag of surrender," explaining that he will not trade looking his
    colleagues in the eye for safety. The moment crystallizes Josh''s buried trauma
    and his moral choice to stand with his chosen family—an act that both rejects
    special treatment and tightens group loyalty as the threat of smallpox hangs over
    the White House. Bartlet''s paternal pride and the staff''s communal warmth transform
    the refusal into a turning point: a personal sacrifice that deepens the emotional
    stakes and affirms the theme of loyalty to friends over personal preservation.'

  key_dialogue:
  - Mr. President, there's something that's been bothering me for most of the day,
    and while I know that this is an inappropriate time...
  - I serve at the pleasure of the President, and it's a great privilege that I will
    never forget. [takes out the card from his wallet, a card that has bothered him
    for the whole day. He shows it to Leo and the President.] I can't keep this. I
    think it's a white flag of surrender. I want to be a comfort to my friends in
    tragedy. And I want to be able to celebrate with them in triumph. And for all
    the times in between, I just want to be able to look them in the eye. Leo, it's
    not for me. I want to be with my friends, my family, and these women.
  - Here's to absent friends, and the ones that are here now.
