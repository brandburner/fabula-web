  title: Hoynes Arrives Late and Defends Leo in AA Meeting
  description: In a dimly lit room, seven men begin an AA meeting with the chair solemnly
    reading the Twelfth Step, emphasizing spiritual awakening and amends. Leo sips
    coffee quietly as VP Hoynes enters late, nods, and sits. Light banter about an
    'unflyable' plane eases tension before Man 2nd challenges Leo's presence, arguing
    his public profile breaches anonymity crucial for high-stakes alcoholics. Hoynes
    asserts authority—'my meeting. Leo stays'—reaffirming confidentiality. He shares
    first, revealing his own alcoholism, modeling vulnerability and loyalty. This
    setup excavates conflicts between personal recovery bonds and public exposure,
    foreshadowing political tensions.

  title: Leo Briefs Bartlet on Burning Nuclear Trucks and Stolen Rig Amid Pager Banter
  description: 'Leo enters the Oval Office fresh from his AA meeting, facing Bartlet''s
    playful ribbing about his sobriety ''luxury'' and missing pager, which Bartlet
    cheekily retrieves from his pocket. Leo delivers a tense update on the Idaho crash:
    joint ops established, no radiation release yet, but both nuclear trucks burn
    uncontrollably beyond design limits. Revelation of a stolen second truck, its
    driver Garry Vernon Clarke dead in an apparent accident, escalates the crisis''s
    peril. Bartlet probes the secretive meeting next door; Leo stonewalls. This beat
    humanizes their bond through banter while thrusting Bartlet deeper into national
    security peril, contrasting personal recovery with public catastrophe and teasing
    VP intrigue.'
