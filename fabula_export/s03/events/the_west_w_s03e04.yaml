  title: Kovaleski Delivers Death Tax Override Bill to Nervous Rookie Dolan
  description: In the dimly lit Executive Clerk's office late at night, the stoic
    Kovaleski, accompanied by a uniformed guard, enters and hands rookie clerk Donald
    Dolan—a nervous second-week employee working alone—the blue file containing the
    House-passed 'Death Tax Elimination Act' override bill. Dolan, visibly anxious
    yet protocol-savvy, confirms instructions to notify Deputy Chief of Staff Josh
    Lyman immediately for President Bartlet's signature or veto. He dials Josh right
    as Kovaleski exits, igniting the White House's frantic crisis response and underscoring
    the procedural gravity thrusting the override battle into high gear as a pivotal

  title: C.J.'s Sarcastic Veto Announcement Ignites Press Frenzy
  description: In the packed Briefing Room, C.J. launches a biting, sarcastic announcement
    of President Bartlet's veto of HR10—the 'Death Tax' bill—mocking Republican fearmongering

    urgent questions about a surprise House override vote and the GOP's emergency
    meeting, which C.J. deftly deflects. Comic tension peaks when entertainment reporter
    Sherri Wexler asks about C.J.'s outfit; C.J. dismisses her curtly as 'a dress,'
    exposing her contempt for triviality amid escalating crisis. This beat heightens

  title: 'Natrium Banter: C.J.''s Intellectual Respite'
  description: In a rare pocket of calm outside Leo's office, C.J. geeks out with
    Margaret over sodium's periodic symbol 'Na,' derived from Latin 'natrium' rather
    than English 'soda,' culminating in the wry punchline that it simply means 'sodium.'
    This light-hearted, nerdy exchange reveals C.J.'s vibrant curiosity and provides
    crucial emotional decompression amid the override vote frenzy and fresh Jerusalem
    bombing horror, interrupted by Leo summoning her—emphasizing how staff snatch
    fleeting humanity to sustain under crisis pressure.

  title: Leo Briefs C.J. on Levy Brothers Bombing and Comms Strategy
  description: Leo pulls C.J. into his office for a terse strategy session on the
    Jerusalem suicide bombing, now breaking news. He reveals the victims were American
    brothers from the Levy family, killed at a soccer match, but instructs her to
    withhold names and targeting speculation to protect security. C.J. offers to absorb
    press heat so the grieving Levys learn from the President directly, who will call
    them. She can confirm Bartlet's outreach to Israel's PM but must dampen expectations
    of restraint amid Erev Yom Kippur tensions. This efficient beat equips C.J. for
    her briefing, excavating the conflict between empathy and geopolitical pragmatism
    while escalating the crisis arc.

  title: C.J. Presses Charlie's Steadfast Immunity Refusal
  description: Emerging from Leo's office into the outer hallway, C.J. intercepts
    Charlie, urgently confronting his refusal to accept an immunity deal amid the
    share-trading scandal probe. She pushes hypothetically, framing it as a 'get out
    of jail free' card that spares him endless legal hours, intuiting his loyalty
    to President Bartlet as the barrier. Charlie stonewalls with curt deflections,
    insisting no one's going to jail and dodging discussion. The exchange peaks in
    tense subtext-laden silence, broken by Charlie's awkward, unflinching joke offer
    to 'watch' her change clothes—quickly whispered 'No'—revealing his protective
    allegiance while personalizing the White House's mounting legal peril amid dual
    crises.

  title: Toby Corners Defector Kimball on Grazing Fees Ultimatum
  description: Outside the White House, Toby intercepts late-arriving Congressman
    Kimball, sharply rebuking his delay and sudden betrayal on the veto override vote.
    Kimball smugly reveals his four proxies, granting him leverage to demand concessions

    historical support for Tennessee farmers via TVA and safety nets, decrying the
    defection from a Democratic president. Outmaneuvered and time-starved, Toby grudgingly
    pivots to negotiation, exemplifying the frantic, principle-testing horse-trading

  title: Sam Pitches Bipartisan Flip to Republicans
  description: As Toby exits Leo's office post-hardline directive, Sam urgently pulls
    him aside, proposing they extend the same concessions—grazing fee moratoriums,
    farm subsidies, and FDA crackdowns—already tabled for Democrats to farm-state
    Republicans like Royce. Royce could deliver six GOP votes for seven total, flipping
    Kimball's defectors upon glimpsing victory, enabling C.J. to tout bipartisanship
    while amplifying Leo's aggressive 'elbow' on national TV. This tactical pivot
    transforms potential defeat into a decisive, image-boosting win, revealing Sam's
    strategic foresight amid escalating override pressure.

  title: Toby Abruptly Rejects Kimball's Demands
  description: In Toby's office, Congressman Kimball resumes negotiating concessions
    for his override vote support—tougher FDA crackdowns on antibiotics, lower ag
    subsidies, production contracts, GAO review suspension, and frozen grazing fees.
    Toby flatly rejects everything with unyielding 'No's,' listing each demand before
    demanding Kimball vacate the room. Sam politely but firmly ushers him out. Toby
    immediately pivots to their bipartisan gambit, summoning Ginger for Republican
    Royce, as Sam underscores the plan's precarious necessity. This turning point

  title: Charlie Defiantly Rejects Leo's Immunity Offer
  description: In Leo's office, a fatherly yet firm Leo urgently presses Charlie to
    accept an immunity deal from a partisan prosecution, warning of bankruptcy and
    ruined law school prospects to shield his young aide from peril. Charlie, eyes
    flashing with resolve, counters that immunity implies guilt and betrays his team's
    trust, vowing to stay loyal despite the risks. Stunned by Charlie's heroism, Leo
    relents just as Margaret interrupts. This tense standoff crystallizes Charlie's
    unwavering integrity, heightening the staff's collective vulnerability amid the
    investigation—a character-defining turning point that costs Charlie personally
    while deepening themes of loyalty and sacrifice.

  title: Carol Urgently Summons C.J. to Oval Office
  description: In the bustling hallway outside the press room, Carol scurries up behind
    the briskly walking C.J., urgently alerting her to a high-stakes meeting in the
    Oval Office. C.J. acknowledges with a clipped 'Thanks,' instantly pivoting from
    press corps skirmishes to senior-level crisis deliberations. This fleeting beat
    masterfully conveys the White House's frenetic rhythm, yanking C.J. from public-facing
    duties into the epicenter of executive decision-making amid the estate tax override
    and Jerusalem bombing crises, heightening anticipation for pivotal plot escalation.

    Forgiveness
  description: 'In the weary predawn Oval Office, an exhausted senior staff—Bartlet,

    pivots to a profound Erev Yom Kippur insight: humans must seek forgiveness from
    each other before God, intertwining personal atonement with diplomatic reckoning.
    Dismissing all for a solitary call to the Levys, he confesses paternal inadequacy,
