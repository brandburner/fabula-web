  title: 'Leo''s Defiant Prep: Delegating Crises, Rebuking Rescue'
  description: Alone at first in the tense congressional meeting room, Leo rapidly
    delegates the escalating church arson threats in Tennessee to Mike Casper, instructing
    him to team with Josh while securing a phone link to monitor. On the call with
    Josh, Leo firmly rejects schemes to extract him from the hearing, exposing Josh's
    guilt-fueled fixer compulsion and Leo's stoic resolve to 'take the hit.' Jordan
    presses him to enter, but Leo defiantly lists crises and banters with press, masking
    nerves while hinting at undisclosed secrets, heightening isolation before the
    MS cover-up showdown.

  title: Bartlet's Banter Bolsters Leo Before the Oath
  description: Margaret interrupts Leo's prep for Jordan's probing, connecting him
    to President Bartlet on the phone. Amid high-stakes tension over MS cover-up and
    Leo's relapse, Bartlet mixes fierce loyalty—urging perjury if needed—with screwball
    levity about Jordan's 'spandex' outfit, then reminds Leo of forgotten Christmas
    Eve plans, restoring normalcy. He pledges the White House staff's solidarity as
    Leo steels for testimony. Post-oath, Leo whispers to Jordan his relapse is 'a
    family thing,' humanizing vulnerability before chaos erupts. This respite beat
    reinforces loyalty, contrasts crisis with domesticity, and sets emotional stakes
    for revelations.
