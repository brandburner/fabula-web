  title: Leo and Jordan's Purposeful March Past Jackson's Portrait to the Guarded
    Door
  description: Emerging from the elevator into the opulent, brightly lit Rayburn House
    hallway at 10:45 PM, Leo McGarry and Jordan Kendall stride forward with unwavering
    focus, passing sculptures and portraits. The camera lingers symbolically on Andrew
    Jackson's portrait—evoking historical censure battles—before revealing three silent
    Capitol policemen guarding the sole door ahead. One officer wordlessly opens it,
    ushering them into the negotiation chamber. This visual buildup amplifies tension,
    foreshadows thematic conflicts over accountability, and propels Leo's defiant
    loyalty toward the core confrontation.

  description: Leo and Jordan enter the dimly lit negotiation room, facing Cliff Calley
    and an unfamiliar counsel at a prepared table. Amid terse greetings, Jordan swiftly

  title: Josh's Vulnerable Crush Confession, Toby Crafts Paid Leave Pretext
  description: In Toby's office, Josh ironically proclaims himself a 'straight shooter'
    before vulnerably confessing his infatuation with Amy Gardner, admitting terror
    of rejection and craving a business pretext to reconnect. Toby, with dry wit,
    brainstorms policy friction points amid White House women's outreach successes,
    landing on the minor shortfall in paid family leave study funding as a fabricated
    feud. This banter humanizes Josh's emotional chaos, fortifies his bond with Toby,
    and sets up a romantic subplot's clumsy advance against the administration's crisis
    backdrop.

    Resolution 172, citing historical precedent like Andrew Jackson's censure. A brief,
