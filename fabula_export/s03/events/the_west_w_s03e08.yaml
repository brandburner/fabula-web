  title: C.J. Reels from Katie's Lawsuit Bombshell
  description: In the midst of the White House press briefing, reporter Katie ambushes
    C.J. with news of a lawsuit against President Bartlet, stemming from a Rocky Mountain
    Herald story about his seatbelt comments at a fundraiser. Visibly stunned and
    unprepared—her 'Sued?' betraying total ignorance—C.J. abruptly terminates the
    session and huddles with deputy Carol in the hallway for intel, exposing a critical
    blind spot in the administration's crisis radar. This jolt underscores C.J.'s
    vulnerability as the public face, priming the lawsuit thread amid cascading crises
    and fracturing the briefing's controlled facade.

    lawsuit query, Toby intercepts her with urgent news: a veterans'' group is threatening

  title: Bartlet Confides Moral Unease Over Qumar Arms Deal to Toby
  description: In the Oval Office, President Bartlet finalizes the Qumar arms package
    details with Toby and Frank—now including two F-117 strike fighters for a ten-year
    Khalifa Airbase lease—then directs them to downplay the announcement via the DoD.
    He vulnerably admits discomfort with arming misogynistic Qumar, fearing judgmental
    looks from female staff, especially C.J., revealing his internal moral turmoil
    amid geopolitical imperatives. Toby downplays it as guilt, securing reluctant
    reassurance, setting up brewing ethical staff divisions and C.J.'s impending outrage.

  title: Abbey Corners Josh on Treaty Flaws After Donna's Bad-Timing Intrusion
  description: Donna barges into Josh's office, drawing his sharp rebuke for interrupting
    his focus with 'banality.' Abbey Bartlet, wheeled in unexpectedly, asserts her
    authority as 'the boss's wife,' shifting dynamics and prompting Donna's exit.

    'forced' qualifier, which she argues undermines sex trafficking prosecutions.

    12,000 of 40 million cattle tested negative, revealing the crisis''s vast stakes.
    This revelation, a pivotal escalation amid White House pressures, burdens Leo

  title: Leo Interrupts Toby's Smithsonian Meeting with Mad Cow Crisis Alert
  description: As Toby presses Smithsonian curators Evan Woodkirk and Mary Kline on
    veterans' boycott of the Pearl Harbor exhibit, Leo knocks urgently and pulls Toby
    into the hallway. Leo briefs him on a presumptive positive mad cow case in Nebraska,

    to prevent panic, aligning with Leo's view, but Leo notes CJ's opposition for
    transparency and the President's demand for details. This intrusion escalates
    crisis overload, thrusting a potential national epidemic into the administration's
    frayed crisis management.

  description: In the White House lobby, Sam warmly greets Tom Starks, a Rotarian,
    and another man, escorting them to his office amid minor backlash over the President's
    anti-seatbelt remark and Josh's Rotary joke. Sam deftly apologizes for Josh and
    pitches a national seatbelt law to preempt escalation, emphasizing lives saved
    (5,000 annually). The men rebuff it as unnecessary damage control, citing Democratic
    priorities, federalism, and governors' opposition, exposing Sam's earnest idealism
    against political pragmatism. This beat showcases Sam's diplomatic finesse while
    underscoring the administration's PR vulnerabilities and his naive policy push

  title: Toby Builds Rapport with Veterans as C.J. Ignites Qumar Clash
  description: Toby greets USF veterans Barney Lang, Ed Ramsey, and Ronald Crookshank
    in the Mural Room, agreeing to a personal favor for Barney's wheelchair-bound
    comrade to foster goodwill. He probes for the exhibit's most offensive element—its
    portrayal of vengeful America—amid debate on invasion casualties. C.J. slips in
    unnoticed, chats amiably with Ed about his Battle of the Bulge heroism, then shocks
    all with a provocative hypothetical equating their protest to arming Nazis, analogizing
    the Qumar deal. Toby yanks her into the hallway, where she defiantly blasts him,
    exposing raw moral fissures in the staff over geopolitical compromises. This pivotal
    intersection humanizes the veterans subplot while detonating the Qumar crisis,
    thrusting Toby between empathy and internal conflict.

    its feet on this." TOBY: "Leave me his information on a piece of paper. I can
    make a phone call for you."'
  - 'TOBY: "Okay. Tell me the point you find most offensive and would like to see
    pulled from the exhibit." BARNEY LANG: "Sections that have the overreaching message
    of a vengeful America and a victimized Japan."'
  - 'C.J.: "You''re protesting because you think the Smithsonian isn''t paying proper
    respect to what you and the soldiers of the 10th Armored, 3rd Army risked and
    lost your lives for six decades ago. How would you feel, in the hypothetical I
    just described, if I told you that at my press briefing at the end of the day
    I was announcing that we were selling tanks, missiles, and fighter jets to the
    Nazis?"'

  title: C.J.'s Nazi-Qumar Analogy Explodes in Veterans' Meeting

    Qumar—like selling weapons to Nazis—exposing her fierce principled stand against
    foreign policy compromises. Toby, stunned, drags her into the hallway, where she

  title: Josh Ambushes Amy for Explosive Walk-and-Talk on Prostitution Rights
  description: Josh surprises Amy exiting Dupont Sports and Fitness at night, propelling
    them into a tense walk-and-talk debate on the UN prostitution treaty. Invoking
    Eleanor Roosevelt's UN speech and upcoming legal revisions, Josh probes Amy's
    advocacy for decriminalization, clashing over government intervention in women's
    bodies. Amy equates it to drug laws and pivots to economic coercion as modern
    subjugation, exposing Josh's legalistic pragmatism against her fervent moral stance.
    This intellectual firefight intensifies their alliance-straining rift, thematically
    echoing Josh's prior Donna debate while amplifying policy tensions amid White
    House crises.

    AMY: "In some cases. But I know of no little girl, and neither do you, who says \"I wanna be a prostitute when I grow up.\" They do it 'cause they're forced to out of economic circumstances. And dire economic need is a form of coersion."
