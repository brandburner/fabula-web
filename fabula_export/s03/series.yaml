      title: Isaac and Ishmael
      logline: During a post-9/11 White House lockdown sparked by a suspected terrorist
        alias matching an innocent Arab-American staffer, Josh Lyman and senior aides
        captivate trapped high school students with fiery lessons on Islamic extremism,
        American pluralism, and heroism over martyrdom.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Chaos erupts in the FBI's Burlington field office as Agent Greg unleashes a NCIC search on 'Yaarun Nabi,' unearthing aliases that scream peril: Raqim Ali among them. Fingers race to the White House Joint Operations Center, igniting a Code Black crash—doors slam, agents swarm, sealing the executive mansion in ironclad lockdown. Josh Lyman, deputy chief of staff, shoulders his bag for escape, but Donna Moss thrusts reality back: Presidential Classroom students await in the northwest lobby, bright-eyed high schoolers hungry for Washington wisdom.

        Agents burst through every portal, barking 'Stay where you are!' Josh shepherds the rattled group—supervised by Marjorie Mann—into the White House Mess, a makeshift classroom amid crisis. 'This is a crash,' he declares, pacing like a caged lion, hands clapping nerves into submission. Billy Fernandez, sharp-tongued, challenges: 'Isn't the Executive the weakest branch?' Josh smirks menacingly, dubbing him 'Fred' and firing back, 'We get a motorcade—back off.' Tension coils as Girl 1 probes, 'What's the deal with everybody trying to kill you?' Josh demurs, then bares scars: Rosslyn shooting, mother's emergency box stuffed with flashlight, water, a signed Joe Pepitone cap. 'I'm not quitting till we win big,' he vows, eyes fierce.

        Students prod deeper: 'Why us?' Josh scrawls on the dry-erase board—'Islamic extremist is to Islamic as blank is to Christianity'—slamming down 'KKK.' Not Arabs, not Muslims serving in uniform, but medieval Klansmen cloaked in faith. Donna snaps at rationalizing bombers; Josh counters with jihadist absurdities: beard lengths mandated, women stoned veil-less, soccer cheers limited to 'Allah-u-Akbar.' Pluralism offends them—churches beside mosques, women astronauts, raucous stadiums.

        Parallel shadows grip a darkened Old Executive Office Building room. Ron Butterfield's Secret Service squad kicks in the door on Raqim Ali, hands skyward, cigarette ash still warm from the window toss. Leo McGarry storms Leos' office, briefed: Khuram Sharif flipped, naming Nabi aliases, one a White House worker. Interrogation unleashes—wires in backpack? MIT math whiz filing papers? Father's Holy Land donation? Rally sans permit protesting troops in holy Saudi? Bomb threat at Edison High? Leo's barbs slice: 'Price you pay for looking like them.' Ali erupts, then steels: 'You don't understand.'

        Back in the Mess, reinforcements charge in. Toby Ziegler banters darkly—'Kill 'em all'—save Yankees, Laker girls, Palm steak—then analogizes Taliban to Nazis over Afghanistan's Poles, Jews unseen in evil. 'Bad people can't be spotted on sight.' Girl 2 puzzles pinochle; Toby groans, 'Kill 'em all again.' Sam Seaborn dives into Assassins—hashish-fueled paradise assassins from Al-Hassan Ibn-al-Sabbah's 11th-century cult. Terrorism's 100% failure: IRA, Basque, Weathermen flop; nonviolence triumphs—Gandhi, Civil Rights. 'Israel lives daily with pizza parlor blasts.'

        CJ Cregg belts CIA anthems: spies over satellites, fund Arabic learners, tap phones, profile, shoot busboys-with-silencers. Toby counters blacklists' Draconian bite; Billy quotes Franklin on liberty forsaken. Charlie Young pierces from Southeast DC's gangs mirroring terror's dignity lure. President Bartlet and Abbey sweep in—'Women bright, men dense'—Bartlet eviscerates martyrdom: 'Sick, twisted murder. We need heroes who live for country.' Abbey weaves genesis: Isaac and Ishmael, Jews and Arabs burying Abraham, ancient rift craving reconciliation.

        Raqim clears: Germany's the real alias hit. Leo's stare lingers, haunted by Rosslyn's white shooters targeting diversity. Abbey exits; Josh rejects death penalty—endless loops of victims' joys, nightly punches. 'Embrace pluralism—it drives them mad.' Students file out; Josh nods to Billy, 'Keep doing what you're doing.'

        Leo haunts Ali's office, apology raw: 'That's the price... for having the same features as criminals.' Retracts Saudi crack. 'Way to be back at your desk,' he murmurs as Buffalo Springfield wails warnings of battle lines, resistance, the imperative to look what's going down. In this aberration episode—profits to 9/11 funds—fear fractures prejudice, heroes rise over martyrs, America affirms: pluralism endures, heroes live to fight, bury ancient hatreds together.

      title: Manchester Part I
      logline: President Bartlet barrels toward re-election announcement despite MS
        cover-up fallout, clashing with furious wife Abbey, fractious campaign team,
        and a colliding FDA RU-486 approval that threatens to derail his defiant bid
        for a second term.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Cameras blaze as President Jed Bartlet storms the podium, jaw set, pockets stuffed with resolve: 'Yeah. And I'm going to win.' Four weeks shatter in flashbacks—reporters savage C.J. Cregg over Special Prosecutor whispers; Abbey Bartlet drains her wine, venom lancing through marital frost: 'You buried Dolores Landingham this afternoon... you couldn't possibly be expected to make such a decision.' Bartlet bolts for Haiti briefings, ordering Operation Swift Fury helicopters that claw Americans and leader Dessaline from embassy rooftops amid Cobra gunfire and explosions. Staff erupts in Josh's bullpen: Donna pumps adrenaline, Toby drips sarcasm, Sam grins through chaos. Polls flicker hope—41% re-elect—but Joey Lucas signs fury at bogus Michigan samples.

        Cut to Manchester, New Hampshire, Air Force One's belly: Bruno Gianelli prowls, shoving apology drafts at Leo McGarry, who snarls, 'He's not going to apologize.' C.J. dodges Josh's rage over FDA's RU-486 greenlight crashing Monday's speech; Toby clashes with Doug Wegland in dim bars, pool cues cracking like alliances. Reporters hound C.J.: 'Speech done?' She lies smooth until fatigue cracks her—flashback presser erupts, Carl's barb lands: 'Does the President's situation make it harder to focus on Haiti?' C.J. snaps, 'To be honest, he's relieved to be focusing on something that matters.' Silence implodes; Toby flees, head in hands; Leo thunders, 'C.J. doesn't misspeak!' Team spirals: Sam bites back at exhaustion barbs, Josh leaks tobacco firebombs against advice.

        Charlie hustles pool sharks, dodges Babish's subpoena dread; Donna pilfers Josh's fries amid Connie's quips. Bartlet, at his farm's fence, drags on cigarettes, eyes locked on grazing cows: 'Screw it! It's game time.' Leo shadows, pitching postponements amid laryngitis feints, Abbey's looming arrival, C.J.'s ghosts. Bartlet wheels: 'I'm running for reelection, and I'm gonna win.' Horizon swallows them, resolve hardening against scandal's storm, family's fracture, campaign's grind—stakes tower: legacy, love, leadership teeter on Manchester's edge.

      title: Manchester Part II
      logline: President Bartlet battles clashing egos among his senior staff and
        slick new consultants to forge a unified re-election launch, confronting the
        MS cover-up's scars, marital frost, and political gambles that threaten to
        derail his principled bid for a second term.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Chaos erupts in a New Hampshire barn as President Josiah Bartlet rehearses his re-election speech, Toby Ziegler skewers Doug's pom-pom patriotism, a garter snake slithers into C.J. Cregg's nightmares, and Bruno Gianelli storms in wielding pitchfork threats to whip the bickering team into shape. Flashbacks wrench back four weeks: Bartlet dodges Abbey's pleas amid Haiti brinkmanship, buzzing Bazan's palace with Alpha strikes before brokering a tense surrender—no private jet for the dictator, just Caracas exile and unfrozen accounts. C.J. reels from press room pummeling, Nancy preps to brief in her stead, Leo stonewalls Josh's RU-486 panic as FDA timing torpedoes the kickoff.

        Tensions coil tighter at the Bartlet farm. Josh corners Leo on heartland backlash to the abortion pill announcement, Sam clashes with Doug over America's 'rocking' greatness, while C.J. braves Abbey's cider denial after unnamed source rumors of marital ice fracture solo Air Force One photos. Leo unleashes fury on C.J. for Haiti grudge-holding and Toby leaks. Bruno's arrival flashbacks reveal his hardball hiring: 13% ad cut (Bartlet caps at 12%), no unfettered Oval access, but his win machine gears up despite Toby's Shiva gloom and Josh's tobacco blunder confession—premature press releases squander swing-state gold.

        Nightmares haunt: Sam pores over transcripts, seething that Bartlet never apologized for MS omission sins. Toby whaled on him once; now resentment festers beneath Kool-Aid denial. Connie prods Sam's loyalty ache, Doug needles Toby's parade rage, Bruno locks the speech sans apology. Abbey explodes in flashback ottoman wars—'jackass' barbs fly over agriculture tomes masking deeper rifts.

        Dawn fractures resolve. Josh smashes doorframes in Donna's gaze, RU-486 and tobacco ghosts fueling exhaustion. C.J. endures Bartlet's barn rebuke—'Don't be a marriage counselor'—before tender confession: 'I was never supposed to win,' Iowa surges a fluke, 'I need you too.' Motorcade hurtles: Bartlet quips moon-landing divorces to thaw Abbey, who leans toward his vote.

        High school hallway pulses with band blasts, balloon frenzy. Staff erupts over 'torpor' as Abbey intones intros. Bartlet bursts in: 'They can look it up!' He pivots, voice cracking—Churchill heft, FDR thunder. 'I never said I'm sorry. I am.' For lawyers, press, mess, fear. New consultants crave victory; staff demands righteousness. 'We're gonna write a new book... worthy of us, of America.' Door swings, Abbey summons: 'Josiah Bartlet!' He halts, grins fierce: 'Break's over.'

        Podium thunder: Kiss for Abbey, wave to roar, staff flanks him—unity forged in apology's fire. MS shadows lift, rifts heal, stakes soar. Bartlet launches not as happy warrior, but restless prophet, envy of civilizations rekindled, pitchforks buried. Re-election ignites on integrity's blaze, heartland heartbeats syncing to a higher denominator.

      title: Ways and Means
      logline: As special prosecutor Clem Rollins subpoenas President Bartlet and
        his inner circle, the White House provokes partisan House hearings to derail
        the fair probe, battles Republican estate tax repeal, woos wavering allies,
        and defies wildfire backlash—all while grief and pressure threaten to unravel
        them.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Subpoenas crash down like thunderbolts in a federal courtroom: Clement Rollins, the unflappable special prosecutor, names Josiah Bartlet, his wife Abbey, daughters Elizabeth, Eleanor, Zoey, Chief of Staff Leo McGarry, Deputy Chief Josh Lyman, Press Secretary CJ Cregg, Deputy Communications Director Sam Seaborn, and Communications Director Toby Ziegler. Oliver Babish confronts Rollins in a tense hallway ambush, pleading good faith amid leaks from the Wall Street Journal, but Rollins impanels the grand jury stone-faced. Smash to main titles—investigation ignites.

        Donna Moss unravels in a chaotic OEOB storage room, boxes of schedules, memos, Secret Service logs, and FedEx receipts exploding her farm-girl sanity as she hunts the master index. Josh flees her frenzy, only to juggle Yellowstone's lodgepole pine inferno: dry lightning sparks 500 acres, but Interior decides to let nature purge and reinvigorate. Sam briefs: President must phone the governor for optics, not action—fire's 'good' in its resource zone. Josh quips ballerina dreams; secrets stick.

        CJ clashes with Oliver and Ainsley Hayes in her office: subpoenas scream guilt to press wolves. She demands offense—Republicans respect Rollins too much for villainy. Storming Leo's domain, CJ pitches chaos: provoke House hearings via a rabid inquisitor like Oversight's Randall Thomas. Leo grins; they bait the trap. Toby rants estate tax hypocrisy—'death tax' spares multi-millionaires—as Republicans cancel compromise meets, eyeing full repeal amid White House weakness.

        Tuesday surges: Bruno corners Leo with tape of Victor Campos courtside with GOP shark Jack Buckland, ditching Bartlet's Community Empowerment board post-Pacers thriller. Sam probes the union boss's betrayal; Bruno demands his spy at the parley. Ainsley pitches Donna a blind date: Cliff Calley, Republican litigator from Ways and Means—Josh's nemesis committee. Donna wavers, exhaustion cracking her armor.

        CJ briefs: 80 unsolicited document cartons to Rollins; subpoenas just 'tools.' Leo beams pride from the shadows. Republicans troll votes; Black Caucus splinters—first black millionaires crave inheritance sans tax. Toby paces Roosevelt Room fury: '98% estates pay zero!' Josh bleeds: 290 override votes loom.

        Wednesday whispers: Hill Dems nudge CJ—downplay Rollins-Babish Yale bonds. She deploys Ainsley off-record: 'Bartlet waives exec privilege but hides docs?' Press bites. Bartlet hunts the perfect pen, Charlie prods secretary hires—Mrs. Landingham's ghost lingers, slipping ink into pockets. Grief stalls resolve.

        Sam grills Connie on AFSE's Campos—California kingmaker, voter machine. Farragut Grill: Donna reschedules Cliff amid box apocalypse; sparks fly, ideologies clash. Republican why? 'Smaller gov.' Date two beckons—until Oversight 'trade' dawns: Ways and Means retaliation?

        Thursday erupts: Mural Room showdown. Campos demands amnesty for Latino undocumented, dropout funds, kids' health. Connie blindsides Sam—bold stroke swells Dem rolls. Deal: California delegates for loyalty. Roosevelt redux: Toby pounds table at Richardson—'We're bleeding!' Veto risk soars, no Caucus bloc.

        Oval huddle: Fire gnaws 6500 acres; Alberta rains gamble. Bartlet eyes Landingham's pens, stamps veto resolve amid governors' pyromaniac jeers. 'American dream tricks all to covet riches.'

        Night bullpen: C.J. pops beer as Thomas gavels Oversight hearings—C-SPAN blares 'abuse of power.' Staff unites: CJ whispers, 'Come and get us.' Oliver scowls irony's loss; White House steel gleams. Investigations multiply, but they charge forward—vulnerable, vengeful, unbreakable.

      title: On the Day Before
      logline: President Bartlet and his staff battle a surprise House override vote
        on his estate tax veto while defusing a Jerusalem suicide bombing that kills
        two American brothers, racing against escalation and personal reckonings on
        Erev Yom Kippur.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Kovaleski thrusts the blue folder—House Resolution 10, the Death Tax Elimination Act—into rookie clerk Donald Dolan's trembling hands deep in the White House night. Dolan dials Josh Lyman as tuxedoed staffers primp for a Nobel gala, but alarms blare: Republicans bolt the dinner, convening emergency leadership. Bartlet strides the colonnade with Leo, soup cooling untouched, sensing the trap. 'They're gonna miss hot pumpkin soup with cheese gnocchi,' Bartlet quips, but dread coils—override vote looms.

        Dolan delivers the bill to the Oval. Staff erupts: Sam urges delay, Toby snarls resolve, Josh eyes weakness. Bartlet seizes the pen, stamps veto with a flourish—NaCl, table salt for CJ's chemist woes—and hurls it back. 'Send it back.' Smash to titles.

        Briefing room crackles. CJ, gown traded for power suit, skewers 'We're Coming to Get Your Children' rhetoric, dodging override whispers. Phones blaze in Roosevelt Room: whip counts shatter—Kimball flips, three Dems vanish on planes. Toby corners Kimball outside: 'How do you do this to a Democratic president?' Grazing fees, farm nets—Kimball's shopping list swells.

        Bomb detonates reality. Nancy McNally storms Leo's office: suicide bomber on Ben Yehuda rips ten lives, two American brothers, Ariel and Noah Levy, targeted in U.S. sweatshirts. Situation Room pulses—traces of C-4 scream Afghan or Iranian ties. Bartlet demands cooling options as F-15s spool heat plumes at Hatzerim.

        Josh duels Indiana Governor Jack Buckland in the Mural Room. Steelworkers clash with owl hugs; asthma stats fly. Buckland probes primary shadows—'Your health scares us,' Josh confesses, dangling Labor nod. Buckland grins: term limits burn.

        Toby yields to Kimball: moratoriums, subsidies. But Leo elbows hard: 'Take it or leave it.' Sam pivots genius—offer Royce the same. Moderate Republican bites, scorning billionaire tax breaks: 'Taxes are the price for civilized society.' Seven votes flip; veto holds.

        CJ eviscerates Sherri Wexler live: wardrobe jabs rebound as credentials yank. 'Hunting season's over.' Charlie stonewalls immunity pleas from all—Toby's flu jab, CJ's hypotheticals, Leo's plea: 'Don't be a hero.' Loyalty steels him.

        Donna unloads on Josh: blind date with Oversight lawyer torpedoes ethics. 'You can't see him anymore.' Hurt fractures their banter; bow tie discards like trust.

        Mounting fury: Israel arms Apaches for Hebron, Ramallah. Bartlet grips portico ledge with Leo: threaten Arafat with $100 million NGO aid cutoff, demand Mujeeb handover. Palestinian police cuff him in Gaza—grenade repins for a day.

        Oval dawn huddle crafts Levy eulogy. Bartlet pauses: Erev Yom Kippur demands human forgiveness first. Staff files out. Alone, receiver heavy, he sighs to grieving parents: 'I have three children. I really don't know what to say.'

        Veto sustains. Crises cool. Armor cracks—political muscle flexes bipartisan, peace teeters held, personal sins beg pardon on the day before atonement. Resolve endures, fragile as tagged C-4 traces, potent as Oval steel.

      title: War Crimes
      logline: President Bartlet weaponizes a deadly Texas church shooting to force
        VP Hoynes into a defiant gun control speech before hostile legislators, igniting
        fierce clashes over loyalty, concealed carry chaos, leaked secrets, and the
        shadows of past war crimes as reelection looms.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Cameras swarm the White House press room, Sunday thunder rumbling outside as C.J. grips the podium, voice steady amid football echoes from TVs. She details the horror: Daryl Bechtell storms United Baptist Church in Abilene, Texas, .38 blazing for his estranged wife, wounding Harold Winter. Chaos erupts; Ron Cahrl draws his concealed Glock, fires wildly—Melissa Markey, nine tomorrow, crumples dead in the crossfire. Laughter dies as C.J. reads the note confirming the girl's fate. Smash to titles.

        Bartlet storms from church, Abbey trailing, dissecting a limp Ephesians homily lacking 'penache.' Passion ignites: words as music, 'Be subject to one another' amid cable news gluttony. Grief crashes in—C.J. delivers Melissa's death. Bartlet reels, demands Leo. Hoynes summoned: Texas calls, gun lobby's state siege weakening carry laws. NRA fattens on concealed chaos; Bartlet thrusts Hoynes toward San Antonio's legislatures, counter-scheduling courage before reelection fire.

        Donna sweats a House deposition, Cliff Calley probing. Subpoenaed, she sorts campaign docs, but lies: no diary. Cliff, lover turned inquisitor, spots it in her apartment, hurls statutes—perjury, obstruction looming. Josh erupts: 'You don't decide what's material!' Tension coils; diary traded in rainy park shadows, Josh's arm awkward shield on the bench.

        Toby, holed in shadows, leaks fire: 'President wins on Hoynes' coattails.' Will Sawyer, Myanmar exile, god to Fijians, snags it. Toby rallies staffers in the mess: 'We're a team... nothing I wouldn't do.' No witch hunt, just raw fealty. C.J. probes Will; he spikes the story, scorning gossip for gravitas.

        Sam battles penny abolition—Lincoln's Illinois tolls, Speaker's veto. 'Funnel people' obsess: zinc-mined obsolescence, jars hoarding two-thirds minted. Toby clinches: dumb reason, good enough.

        Leo spars General Adamley on War Crimes Tribunal. Nuremberg legacy clashes sovereignty; 139 signatories, 60 ratify seals it. Hedge bets? Rolling Thunder ghosts rise—Leo's 1966 F-105 dam strike, 11 civilians dead. 'All wars are crimes.' Leo freezes, hand to face, world tilting.

        Oval Office duel peaks: Hoynes balks, axes Idaho unchecked, Rambo parades sans church signs. Bartlet thunders: 'She was nine!' Stats volley—guns 30k dead, booze more, weed zero. Concealment folly exposed; Second Amendment antiquity. MS shadows erupt: 'You outed me!' Nashua betrayal, mismanaged reveal. Glare locks; Hoynes yields Texas for table seat. Only path to nomination.

        Bartlet strides briefing room, rain-lashed windows framing resolve. Park bench vigil ends cold; diary yields, fragile peace. Staff fractures mend in loyalty's forge—gun scars, leak burns, war haunts—yet White House machine grinds on, subjecting to one another in reverence's tense rhythm. Thunder fades; they endure.

      title: Gone Quiet
      logline: President Bartlet confronts a chilling silence from the nuclear submarine
        U.S.S. Portland lurking off North Korea's coast, balancing a ticking clock
        for rescue against the peril of igniting war, while his staff battles campaign
        smears, soft-money temptations, and scandals threatening his legacy.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Leo bursts into the Situation Room, fury masking dread as Nancy delivers the gut-punch: the U.S.S. Portland, Sea Wolf-class hunter packed with 137 souls and espionage gear, vanishes in the Yellow Sea, perilously close to North Korea's jaws—4,000 yards from Haesong. They've gone quiet, but not by the book. Leo races to Bartlet, yanking him from Marine One's blades and a cherished New Hampshire filing ritual, a 'profound statement about democracy' now sidelined by submarine shadows. Bartlet erupts in the Oval: 'Where's the damn submarine?' Tension coils as Nancy sketches worst cases—flooding, hours to live—while submariners' creed prioritizes national interest over personal survival. Bartlet slaps down a four-hour deadline before unleashing DSRVs, Tomahawks primed from Japan.

        Albie Duncan, grizzled State Department vet, storms in like a thunderhead, schooling the 'kid' President on provocations: USS Pueblo's torture legacy, North Korea's fourth-largest army coiled for crisis. Bartlet bristles, Leo urges trust in captain and crew, but clocks tick mercilessly. Meanwhile, West Wing bullpen pulses with lighter chaos masking deeper stakes. C.J. dances triumph over the Majority Leader's trainwreck answer to 'Why President?'—a word salad of 'greatest natural resources' and vague platitudes. Staff scrambles for Bartlet's own zinger, landing on raw honesty: 'I don't.'

        Subplots ignite like flares. Toby clashes with Tawny Cryer over gutting the NEA's $105 million for park 'security,' defending art's fire—from Phidias to Da Vinci—as society's pulse, not Nazi-vilified degeneracy. Bruno and Connie hawk soft-money 'issue ads' dodging Buckley v. Valeo magic words, leaflets branding Bartlet 'Hopelessly Liberal' demanding preemptive strikes. Sam resists the loophole's siren call, championing leadership by example amid Iowa war chests. Josh dodges Wheatena-wielding seniors, Donna raspberries platitudinous drafts.

        Abbey's wheelchair rolls into Oliver's lair, leg cast no match for malpractice ghosts exhumed by Oversight Democrats. Prescriptions for Jed's MS shatter ethics codes; suits from Hawking to Pendleton circle like vultures. She floats license suspension deals, but Oliver snarls truth over plea bargains: 'Swear the oath, stand up, say STOP!'

        Bartlet's head thuds desk under Albie's litany of sunken ghosts—Glowmar, Gudgeon, Wasp—until zero hour. Officers swarm; Starlifters lift DSRVs. But static cracks: 'Whiskey-Three-Charlie' surfaces on sat-com, deep and quiet evading a Luna destroyer. Relief floods—trust vindicated. Bartlet files for reelection via aide, banters Charlie on Roman togas, goads C.J. on propeller ducks. The Leader's flop lingers, but Bartlet's near-answer simmers: hours of peril crystallize purpose. Submarine shadows lift, but political tempests rage on—soft money cracks pavement, art fights erasure, Abbey steels for truth's forge. In Sorkin's whirlwind White House, crises forge resolve, banter blades wisdom, and democracy's profound statements echo amid the roar.

        staging a lobby sit-in for land rights restitution, as President Bartlet wrestles
        polling-driven Thanksgiving plans, Josh races to secure a killer kid's extradition
        from Italy, and staff scramble over exploding poverty statistics—all on the
        eve of holiday escape.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Chaos erupts in the West Wing on Thanksgiving's doorstep. President Jed Bartlet corners C.J. Cregg in the Oval, droning about turkey brines, Camp David farms, and seventeen spices—anise, coriander—until she flees, boredom shattering into escape. She bursts into the outer office, triumphant in her packed day, only for Josh Lyman to hurl Indians into her path: Maggie Morningstar-Charles and Jack Lonefeather, Stockbridge-Munsee tribal leaders, planted in the lobby, refusing to budge until their 15-year-old land trust application yields answers. Press swarms; irony bites on this pre-holiday eve. C.J. dives in, Harry the guard sidelined, but Maggie and Jack recite treaties—1856 promises of sovereignty shattered by Dawes Act land grabs, rocky soil foreclosures at three cents an acre, Indian Reorganization Act hopes for reclamation. They've lost six treaties, fought in Washington's army, marched from New York to Wisconsin; now a sewage plant and health center hang in limbo at Interior. C.J., distressed, probes deeper, but security tenses as night falls.

        Parallel fires blaze. Josh collides with Leo McGarry over a Georgia 13-year-old who shot his teacher dead, parents FedExing him to Rome. Italy balks at extradition sans death penalty assurances—treaty ironclad—thrusting Josh into diplomacy's viper pit. He corners State’s Russell Angler, charms the Italian Embassy’s Fedrigotti over "Little Red Lighthouse," endures parental punishment parables, then Leo reveals the Pope's shadow: no Vatican scandals on Bartlet's watch. Josh jets to Atlanta's Hartsfield, ginger ale in hand, cornering DeKalb DA Mark Farragut at the bar. Envelope slides across: three fat-cat donor names for TV buys, if Farragut blinks on capital punishment. Flight boards; Farragut grabs it, vanishing to DFW.

        Toby Ziegler and Sam Seaborn grapple poverty's phantom surge: OMB's new formula spikes the line from $17,524 to $20,000, conjuring four million "new" poor overnight—Mollie Orshansky's 1963 Cold War relic exposed as housing-blind farce. Sam woos Bernice Collette with deer-hunting jokes, abacus quips, regional rent gripes; Toby demands delay, spin, or sabotage. Bruno Gianelli looms, white salmon salesmanship: relabel reality, Barnum-style, or torpedo re-election.

        Bartlet fixates: stuffing temps, 165 degrees internal to dodge salmonella carnage; Toby psy-ops recipes—cornbread, oysters, andouille—while pitching nickel-dime wins like neighborhood watch cell phones (82% approval). Polls blindside: voters crave father-figure steadiness at the White House, not New Hampshire farms or Camp David dullness. Bruno invades, kelp-scraping boat hooks schooling Bartlet: voters pick presidents, not plumbers; family optics fuel half-mile gains. J'accuse erupts at Abbey, leg cast-bound, wheelchair-rolled: she greenlit Camp David to dodge Bess Truman marathons, subpoenas, wardrobe polls—yet Bartlet unmasks the pollster traitor. Butterball hotline salvation: Joe Betherson of Fargo dials experts, Toby feeding zip codes, victory crowing.

        Threads collide in resolution's rush. C.J. storms Leo—no five minutes for sit-in rabble—then recites Munsee litany, offers Monday salvation or park police eviction. Maggie counters: what's the alternative to endless small fights against mother injustices? They yield, trailing to her office. Bartlet pivots: White House feast, staff stranded, but polling sated. Josh sips victory; Sam eyes Bruno torpedoes; Toby stalks nephews. Lobby empties, treaties echo, turkey brines, and West Wing exhales into holiday dusk—principles bent, optics burnished, humanity glimpsed in the grind.

      logline: White House staff collide with moral fury as CJ rails against arming
        misogynistic Qumar for a vital airbase lease, while dodging a mad cow crisis,
        a presidential lawsuit, and prostitution treaty clashes that test alliances
        and principles amid skyrocketing stakes.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Chaos erupts in the West Wing as whispers of a lawsuit against President Bartlet ignite the briefing room—Katie's Rocky Mountain Herald scoop reveals a widow blames his offhand fundraiser quip for her husband's unbelted death. Sam pushes preemptive fire with a national seatbelt law, but Bartlet dismisses it, invoking sovereign immunity and scorning political vultures who exploit grief. Toby brushes it off as tort insanity, yet tension simmers, exploding into Dodger Stadium metaphors for how small sparks balloon.

        Inciting shadows deepen: a presumptive positive mad cow test from Nebraska cattle jolts Leo, CJ, and Toby into frenzied debate. CJ demands immediate disclosure to arm the public like soldiers, not victims; Toby counters that panic craters beef industries, topples ranchers, and shatters everyday equilibrium—hamburgers, not sushi, strike the heart. Bartlet weighs economic Armageddon against secrets that haunt, opting to stall 72 hours for UK confirmation, funneling the reveal through HHS to mute White House fingerprints.

        Geopolitical knives twist sharper with Qumar's arms package—15 MRAMs, 50 M1A1 tanks, F-15s, F-117s, Patriot missiles—for a decade-long Khalifa Airbase lease. Bartlet squirms under women's sidelong glares, guilt gnawing as CJ unleashes: a Qumari woman executed for adultery on her husband's word, rape victims beaten by kin. Nancy McNally defends realpolitik—Turkey, Bahrain alternatives lack convenience—yet CJ's tears flow: apartheid pales against Qumar's brutality; arming them shreds gun control moral high ground. Toby absorbs her hallway fury, hands over heart in silent apology.

        Josh tangles with firebrand Amy Gardner over the Vienna UN treaty's 'forced' prostitution clause. Abbey Bartlet prods him; women's coalitions threaten judicial holds. Amy maps global sex trafficking horrors—Thai girls hanged in Bethesda brothels—demanding broader prosecution. Josh parries with alienating legal-prostitution nations like Germany, but Donna's streetwalker hypotheticals crack his armor. Flirtatious balloon animals and water balloons punctuate their ideological tango, yielding alternative language review. Josh concedes no little girl dreams of whoredom; Amy equates dire need to coercion.

        Veterans' shadows loom: a tiny USF faction boycotts the Smithsonian's Pearl Harbor exhibit for 'America-bashing'—racist posters, vengeful narratives, child's scorched lunchbox. Toby mediates with curators Evan and Mary, then vets Barney, Ed, and Ronald, promising Medicaid wheelchairs and exhibit sit-downs. CJ crashes the Mural Room parley, equating Qumar arms to selling tanks to Nazis if Bulge boys lost; Toby hauls her out, earning a blistering 'shove it.' Bartlet prods Toby's subtle shift from NEA defender to veterans' ally, urging CJ amends.

        Turning tides crest in Oval showdowns. Bartlet greenlights mid-level mad cow briefings, DOD Qumar burial, Vienna tweaks. He rebuffs Sam's seatbelt crusade—New Hampshire hates mandates—yet vows to sign if Congress delivers. Toby evolves, brokering veteran peace; Bartlet dials Medicaid himself, confessing red tape origins. CJ briefs with barbed Qumar carpet jabs, cake-sharing levity masking women's anguish. Threads knot in uneasy balance: crises contained, not conquered, as principle clashes policy in the West Wing's relentless churn. Moral fractures linger—Qumar's guns fire tomorrow's wars, mad cow lurks, women's voices echo unanswered.

      title: Bartlet for America (Restructured)
      logline: White House Chief of Staff Leo McGarry endures a congressional hearing
        probing President Bartlet's hidden MS diagnosis, battles to shield his recent
        alcoholic relapse from exposure by a key witness, and navigates national church
        arson threats amid personal and political reckonings.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Leo McGarry sits alone at the witness table in a packed congressional hearing room, a ticking clock underscoring the tension as he juggles a national crisis: fresh threats against black churches in Tennessee ignite fears of arson conspiracies. FBI agent Mike Casper briefs him before rushing to aid Josh Lyman on the ground, while Leo steels himself for questions about Bartlet's concealed multiple sclerosis during the campaign. The President calls, barking orders to protect Leo at all costs, even perjury, though Leo quips about insecure lines and global eavesdroppers. Jordan Kendall, his sharp counsel, prods him toward the fray; Leo jests about tomato juice to mask deeper nerves.

        Chairman Bruno convenes the House Reform and Government Oversight Committee. Majority Counsel Cliff Calley opens measuredly, tracing Leo's history with Bartlet back 32 years, to that pivotal New Hampshire statehouse meeting four years prior. Flashback: Leo pitches the napkin-scribbled 'Bartlet for America' slogan to a skeptical Governor Jed Bartlet amid bungled tourism pitches and leaf-peeping schemes. Rathburn presses Leo on whether he'd have backed Bartlet's run knowing of the MS; Leo dodges, bantering privately with Jordan about lunch, irking the congressman.

        Erickson invokes constitutional succession, probing VP John Hoynes' selection. Leo snaps back fiercely: MS isn't fatal, demanding an apology for stigmatizing families. In the waiting room, Jordan demands full disclosure; Leo confesses his relapse on debate night in St. Louis, drunk before two CEOs and Congressman Darren Gibson, who now threatens to expose him. 'Ain't nothin' but a family thing,' Leo admits, echoing his lineage of alcoholics. Only Josh and Bartlet know; relapse shatters embraces. Jordan agrees to dinner, vowing to steer his answers.

        Outside, Cliff clashes with Gibson, decrying bush-league tactics to humiliate Leo over sobriety—the hearings target campaign ethics, not personal demons. Cliff warns he'll resign and sabotage the party if Gibson proceeds. Bruno recesses until January 5th, stunning Leo and Jordan, granting two weeks' reprieve. Cliff's gaze meets Leo's in silent acknowledgment.

        Parallel crisis escalates: 34 churches burned over 17 months. Josh pushes Tennessee Governor Edward for National Guard federalization; Bartlet invokes Eisenhower and Kennedy. Agent Casper cracks the case—a 17-year-old dropout nabbed for a brake light, spilling a Molotov plot. Bartlet deploys troops, praising Casper's break.

        Flashbacks deepen stakes. Campaign storefront antics—basketball through windows—spur policy speeches, physicals, financial disclosures. Abbey resists the exam, fearing MS revelation; Bartlet insists on transparency before Super Tuesday wipeout. At the DNC, Bartlet offers Hoynes VP slot post-nomination, revealing MS; Hoynes storms out, demanding time. Debate night: Leo succumbs to Johnny Walker Blue with donors, Gibson witnesses his bender as Josh calls—the Governor collapses from MS flare-up, aides summon Abbey amid chaos.

        Hearing adjourns without Gibson's bomb. That night, Bartlet waits in Leo's dim office, gifts the framed napkin: origins of their quest. 'Merry Christmas, Leo.' Alone, Leo clutches it, tears breaking his iron facade. Loyalty endures; secrets bind them tighter than scandals.

      title: H. Con-172
      logline: White House Chief of Staff Leo McGarry defiantly rejects a congressional
        offer to end damaging hearings via a historic censure of President Bartlet,
        but Bartlet seizes the moment to confess his wrongdoing, embracing accountability
        amid loyalty's fierce pull and political peril.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Shadows lengthen in the Rayburn House Office Building as Leo McGarry and Jordan Kendall stride past Capitol Police into a tense midnight parley. Cliff Calley lays bare the deal: kill the hearings, Gibson's testimony, the First Lady's grilling—all for H. Con-172, a blistering resolution branding President Josiah Bartlet a liar who deceived America. Leo erupts, loyalty steeling his spine—he takes bullets for Jed, not the reverse—storming out into the night, wings unflapped to Neverland. Jordan lingers, securing one day to sway him.

        Dawn cracks over the Roosevelt Room where Sam Seaborn rallies the troops against Ron Burkhalt's venomous tome, 'The Camera Doesn't Lie,' a fired photographer's kiss-and-tell spewing half-truths and petty barbs. Josh Lyman commandeers Toby Ziegler for romantic reconnaissance, fabricating friction over paid family leave to lure Amy Gardner into a late-night clash that ignites old sparks amid ballet dates and water balloons. Meanwhile, Bartlet cradles Charlie Young's flea-market treasure—a 1709 map of Canaan, Palestine, the Holy Land—its lines igniting absurd fury for snubbing Israel before Israel's birth.

        Jordan corners Leo relentlessly, scrolls of toothless resolutions in hand—praises for Ohio mottos, Mongolian friendships, Little League—yet this censure packs devastation, Congress's roar without cuffs. Leo digs in, his exit a thunderclap protecting his chief. Subplots swirl: Toby shrugs off the book's prickly mumblings; C.J. Cregg corrals the press, dismissing refutations as volunteer victimhood; Donna Moss dodges Cliff's shadowy summons to broker a lifeline for Leo via Josh.

        Snow buries D.C. as tensions peak. Josh presses Leo in the White House Mess—censure as press release, history's footnote like Jackson's bank brawl—yet Leo invokes presidential scars that never heal. Amy storms Josh's stoop, lips crashing in raw confession: he never mastered the dance after 'like.' But Oval Office thunder rolls louder. Bartlet, communing with counsel, owns his deceit—not sinister starts, but chances squandered to come clean. No more obfuscation, no moral safe houses. He greenlights H. Con-172, concurrent not joint, signing his shame into history's ledger, Jackson's expungement a faint echo.

        The Speaker's voice booms: Congress condemns Bartlet's 'deceitful conduct,' prejudicing justice, injuring the people. Fade to black on a leader unbowed, responsibility's weight crushing yet liberating. Amid bookish distractions, romantic fumbles, cartographic crusades, the core fractures open—loyalty bends to truth, power yields to principle, as the West Wing braces for the storm's full fury.

      title: 100,000 Airplanes
      logline: President Bartlet and his speechwriters clash over injecting a bold
        cancer-cure pledge into the State of the Union after a humiliating censure,
        risking ridicule for redemption as dials spike on raw presidential fire and
        personal ghosts haunt the West Wing.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Screens blaze with President Jed Bartlet's State of the Union, dials twitching in shadowy focus groups from Macomb to Oklahoma. Sam Seaborn, jaw set beside ex-fiancée Lisa Sherborne, watches lines surge—reds, blues, greens leaping past 65—as Bartlet thunders against terror's caves, vowing no enemy escapes. Applause erupts; Sam beams, pride cracking his guarded shell. But triumph teases deeper fractures.

        Flashback rips to the White House lobby, post-address party pulsing with chardonnay and backslaps. Josh Lyman stalks Amy Gardner, her frost biting as he needles her Congressman Tandy fling—political ploy, he insists, Tandy chasing women's votes against Nan Lieberman's primary threat. Amy fires back, heels clicking away; Josh stews, vodka in hand. Sam parries Lisa's probes on axed lines, like curing cancer—'this close,' he quips, deflecting with wry deflection.

        Two weeks prior, censure lands like a gut punch. Leo McGarry delivers the verdict: Bartlet accepts rebuke, no impeachment dance. Staff reels in Roosevelt Room—'Civil War since last time,' Toby Ziegler growls. C.J. Cregg frets exposure; Josh rallies, 'He'll take it from there.' Speechwriting grinds: memos avalanche from Kissinger to Mr. Rogers, whiteboards drown in 'nowhere,' Bartlet paces Oval demanding visions amid budget binds.

        Inspiration strikes at residential dinner, Abbey's oncologist pals dissecting signal transduction inhibitors—smart bombs on sphingosine kinase. Bobby drops the bomb: ten years to chronic cancer. Bartlet snaps alive, 'Put your asses in chairs,' commanding genesis like Kennedy's moonshot. Staff summons midnight Oval: Toby warns ploy, C.J. scents MS deflection, Joey Lucas signs skepticism—'magic trick won't park it deep.' Sam champions ambition, 'overreaching is good.' Bartlet demands drafts.

        Toby crumples pie-fueled despair; Josh bolts from Amy's bar spat—'Surrey with the Fringe on Top' mocking his wreckage—to face Bartlet's audacity. Feasibility crumbles: no experts lined, OMB unscored, pharma unwooed. Sam drafts glory—'full resources to cure by decade's end'—but Bartlet shelves it, 'good ideas, other good ideas.'

        Present surges: Joey's dials plummet first 20—censure shadow, Dems mid-50s, Indies low-40s. Tension coils; Josh badgers, Donna ribs manual-reading cuts. Amy smacks Josh, defends Tandy's feminist creds—clinic violence federalized over White House hesitation. Tandy photo-ops her away; Josh mutters 'we'll see.'

        Climax erupts: Joey unveils panel backs—trust surges 41 to 60, strength hits 69. Cheers explode—hugs, kisses, Josh hoists C.J., Bartlet envelops Sam and Toby: 'Get these guys pie.' Euphoria floods bullpen. C.J. beams at Sam, 'impossible job done.'

        Yet substance haunts. Sam escorts Lisa to his office, reads deleted cancer draft echoing FDR's 50,000 planes doubled to 100,000, armada blotting sun. Lisa passes notes onward; Sam highlights, deletes—blank page stares back. Fade to black, ambition's echo lingering: flash ignited dials, but true liftoff demands planes beyond promise. Stakes tower—reelection teeters on one speech, censure's scar fades under bold vigilance, staff binds tighter in shared overreach. Bartlet strides unbowed, West Wing humming with what might have been, what was achieved: not cure, but conviction reignited.

      logline: President Bartlet confronts his fractured identity—the disarming professor
        masking a brilliant, rage-fueled Nobel laureate—as Toby Ziegler demands he
        unleash his true self against rival Ritchie during the Iowa caucuses, risking
        re-election and dredging up childhood abuse.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Dawn cracks over Josh's dim apartment as Amy bursts in at 5:14 a.m., flaunting proof that Congressman Tandy's courtship isn't political maneuvering—until she drops the bomb: he proposed marriage. Josh's relief surges, then crashes; she rejected him, but their own electric six nights ignite unresolved tension. She storms out; he launches into a sultry recounting of their encounters—only to discover Leo on the line, summoning him to tackle Vieques chaos. Protesters, led by Josh's activist pal Billy Molina, blockade a live-fire range, stalling Navy ships desperate for Indian Ocean deployment. Josh's loyalty fractures: arrest them or negotiate? Leo thrusts him into the fray.

        Air Force One slices through turbulence toward Iowa's unchallenged Democratic caucus. C.J. bickers reassuringly with her fretful dad; Toby clashes with her over affirmative action, her immigrant father's bypassed promotions fueling her skepticism. Bartlet dodges Ritchie's referendum endorsement, scripting a vague nod to equality that Toby savages as evasive fluff. 'Uncle Fluffy' evades the fight, prioritizing stealth over showdown in a won state.

        Back in the White House, Donna wheedles jury duty escape from Josh, who stonewalls; Sam coaches her voir dire sabotage amid his own absurdity—UFO zealot Bob Engler insists Fort Knox hoards alien corpses from Roswell, not gold. Sam stonewalls, but intrigue lingers.

        Josh phones Billy amid target-range peril, Puerto Rico's depleted uranium scars justifying defiance. Tensions spike; Navy brass demand hardball. Josh erupts: 'When is the time to protest?' Deal struck: protesters evacuate for a high-level sit-down.

        Amy rallies Women's Leadership Coalition, torching anti-choice Congress. Josh crashes, sweeps her into impulsive paradise—'Tahiti tomorrow.' She bites, bikinis primed. But duty collides: Vieques meeting slots day after. Leo greenlights Josh's getaway; honor binds him. He bails on Amy; she snaps, likening him to Tandy's opportunism. Iowa victory lands like ash.

        Toby shadows Bartlet post-caucus, decrying his dodged Ritchie jab as spineless. C.J. reveals her dad's dementia, promotions lost to 'less-qualified' minorities haunting her. Toby probes deeper in Oval twilight bourbon haze: Ritchie's plain-spoken masculinity trumps Bartlet's elite intellect. 'Two Bartlets' emerge—the aw-shucks dad masking a salvation-hungry lethal force, forged by father's fists for outshining him.

        Bartlet explodes: 'Get it out of my house!' Toby retreats, TV blaring Iowa triumph. Josh transforms his apartment into Tahitian fever dream—lei-draped, rum-flowing—Amy arrives skeptical, melts into his orbit as UB40 pulses. Politics yields; passion claims the night.

        Resolution coils in revelation: Bartlet's facade crumbles under Toby's scalpel, exposing wounds that propel his presidency's raw duality. Staff entanglements—Josh recommits amid duty's pull; C.J. mourns paternal fade; Sam shrugs off cosmic cons—mirror the President's schism. Primaries loom; Ritchie surges. Vulnerability weaponizes into resolve. Iowa's quiet win belies brewing war: hearts must banish discrimination, or elections devour the divided soul. Themes thunder—affirmative action's bitter equity, personal ghosts haunting public masks, power's cost in authenticity. Bartlet stands exposed, lethal intellect unchained, primaries' gods granting prayed-for foes.

        unearths buried paternal rejection, forcing a clandestine therapy session
        with Dr. Stanley Keyworth amid White House tempests over a bold UN speech,
        a reporter's jungle death, and fracturing loyalties.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Lightning cracks the night sky as Josh Lyman escorts psychiatrist Stanley Keyworth through shadowed White House corridors, bags in tow, under pretense of his own lingering post-shooting trauma. Stanley probes gently amid the tour—Resolute Desk gleaming, Roosevelt Room echoing—but Josh's deflections crack when Leo McGarry materializes, revealing the true quarry: President Jed Bartlet himself, sleepless since Iowa's victory lap. 'Did you know anyone on the plane?' the ritual question hangs, a nod to shared scars from bullets that pierced their worlds.

        Doors seal in the President's private study, where Bartlet dodges Stanley's scalpel: no arthritis, no heartburn, just four relentless nights awake. Cigarette smoke curls as nicotine fails its siren call; TV flickers with C.J. Cregg's press lid on the incendiary UN speech brewing downstairs. Toby Ziegler paces Leo's office, defending rhetoric that brands Islamic fanaticism a 'crushing yoke,' while ex-wife Andy Wyatt storms the bullpen, demanding softer tones lest coalitions shatter and wars ignite. 'They'll like us when we win,' Toby snarls, unyielding.

        Parallel storms rage: In a dim bar, Donna Moss sips temptation—a dot-com throne as Issues Director, salary gleaming brighter than Josh's title tweaks. 'This job may not be around a year from now,' he jabs, masking unease as she drifts toward escape. Sam Seaborn flirts fire with Ainsley Hayes's backless gown—'enough to make a good dog break his leash'—igniting Celia Walton's feminist fury. Ainsley counters with lipstick defiance: 'I like sex. It enhances my power,' silencing the bullpen in stiletto-sharp truth.

        Congo's jungles claim reporter Bill Price, Mai-Mai rebels snuffing his satellite whispers. C.J. battles attaché Loboko in Leo's lair—'How much money, and where does it go?'—only for Josh to deliver the gut-punch: ambush death. Widow Janet crumbles as Donna brews weak coffee, whispering C.J.'s reporter love.

        Deepest thunder rolls in Bartlet's soul. Stanley dismantles defenses: not stress, but Iowa's echo—a Toby chat piercing fatherly frost. 'My father never liked me at all.' Goals cascade—Harvard, Nobel dreams—yet Lincoln's shadow looms, grading Bartlet on curtailed boldness, electoral Michigan over moral fire. 'You're destined for something else,' Stanley stabs, clocking out at double rate. Alone, Bartlet eyes paternal photo, Lincoln portrait, ignites a smoke by storm-lashed panes. Rain hammers as White House pulses—speeches sharpened, coalitions tenuously taped, ambitions tested—Bartlet exhales into the void, confronting the man beneath the crown.

Bartlet dives into the limo, greenlights the Seventh Fleet barreling toward the Strait. Stakes skyrocket: largest U.S. armada since Vietnam looms, nuclear shadows flicker over Asia.

        Situation Room pulses with brass and briefs. Nancy McNally maps Super Cobras scrambling, Nimitz and Independence converging. Bartlet orders Carl Vinson's detour, eyes locked on the board—chess sets from India's Prime Minister scatter like omens across desks. C.J. stonewalls press wolves, dropping trivia bombs on Hartsfield's Landing: New Hampshire's 42-voter crystal ball, voting at midnight, unerring since Taft. Democracy's purest pulse, ticking down.

        Josh Lyman unleashes Donna Moss on Flender parents, tackle-shop loyalists defecting to Ritchie over idle pulp mills, Canadian imports, salmon runs, sales taxes—retail politics freezes her in Lafayette Park, Josh's coat no match for desperation. She parries gripes; he scripts comebacks: trade aid, small loans, balanced budgets. Futility gnaws—42 votes command 21 hours of airtime.

        Bartlet prowls West Wing corridors, gifting chess heirlooms, schooling Sam Seaborn in Fibonacci openings amid crisis calculus. Taiwan's secret: first free elections ignite Beijing's fury, not Patriots. Toby Ziegler inherits a Mountbatten board in Oval Office shadows, Evans Gambit clashing with re-election barbs. 'Bartlet Psychosis'—folksy facade masks heavyweight intellect. Toby jabs: stop smoothing edges, own the smarts. Vulnerability cracks: sleepless nights, father's ghost, David Wheaton's stabbed heroism fueling grandmaster fire.

        Chinese Ambassador erupts in Mural Room—arms sales encroach sovereignty; Patriots trigger CSS-6s. Leo stonewalls; carrier groups slice international waters. C.J. leaks Vinson-Independence maneuvers, South China media bites. Sirens wail as C.J.'s swiped ID—Charlie Young's—triggers lockdown; pizza boxes tumble in absurd feud escalation. Glue-gunned phones, signed schedules clash in petty war mirroring grand strategy.

        Donna exhales frost at gates, Josh commandeers call: let Flenders vote. Moral high ground cedes to midnight ritual. Toby lays down king: 'You're not folksy—be the heavyweight.' Bartlet snaps it up—game unfinished. Sam puzzles Eisenhower's ghosts, Quemoy ghosts; Bartlet reveals the play. Leo bursts in: China stands down war games, permits one Patriot test. U.S. shelves Aegis Destroyers for a decade—$3.2 billion face-saver, lives preserved, Taiwan's democracy breathes.

        Bartlet crowns Sam's checkmate, whispers presidential fire: 'Don't be scared.' Toby's checkered truce simmers; staff erupts for pizza amid bullpen hum. TVs flicker: Hartsfield registrar intones names—Claire Abernathy, young Lillian's first vote—ballots drop under 'America's First Primary' banner. Democracy dawns raw, unfiltered, 42 souls scripting superpower fate.

        Jed Bartlet hunches over a crossword in the presidential bedroom, black tie crisp but jacket slung aside, needling Abbey as she primps in olive silk for her birthday gala. Impatience crackles; she's braced for tomorrow's medical board hearing over illicit Betaseron prescriptions. 'Libertarianism' fills the grid, but Abbey snaps back 'Social Darwinism,' their banter a shield against dread. Jed reassures—'They're gonna give you the very least'—yet conviction cost her leniency. He explodes: 'For the love of God, get out of this room!' Tension snaps like a taut wire.

        Red carpet swallows them in the White House corridor, Secret Service shadows flanking. Jed recites pheasant consommé and Kumquat Napoleons, Gatsby without the ghosts. Doors burst; trumpets blare 'Ladies and gentlemen, Abbey Bartlet!' Applause thunders from 200 guests. Abbey hisses for relaxation; Jed mutters 'It's gonna be relaxed.' Cameras flash as they mingle, Marbury storms in growling 'Your breasts are magnificent!' Chaos reigns—British lord presses on Brendan McGann's White House invite, Sinn Fein terrorist to some. 'Gerald!' he barks at Leo, diplomacy fracturing over IRA ghosts.

        West Wing pulses: CJ hunts rumors of Robert Nolan's recusal from Abbey's hearing—swing vote, family friend. Leo dispatches her covertly, taxis swapped to dodge press. Sam clashes with Leo over Dalton Millgate's supercollider plea; Jack Enlow looms as anonymous hold saboteur. Josh finds Donna in the bullpen, red gown amid files—Secret Service flags her: 'U.S. Citizen: N.' Born four miles off Minnesota's redefined border, now Manitoba. Panic simmers; she quips through tears, 'They'll shoot me.'

        Party swirls romantic: Josh and Amy dance, her feminist fire igniting—'Women are 60% of the vote!' Abbey echoes later, shoving a list of female hires at Josh. Leo coaches Abbey on testimony poise—'Smile but not smug'—campaign limits loom, South off-limits. Bartlet paces portico with Charlie, toasting trials aborted: Stuarts' spiced wine, ditch-digger digs. CJ delivers the blow: Union-Leader confirms Nolan's recusal. Abbey's license hangs by a thread.

        Act Two detonates: Chuck Kane eyes campaign deputy slot; Amy tricks Josh into gender parity war. Marbury corners Toby—'Terrorist in green necktie!'—Sinn Fein as IRA wing. They flee to a bar, Lagavulin burning throats, dead Irish writers invoked: Joyce's nightmare history, O'Neill's repeating past. 'Kipling warned of blame,' Marbury growls. Sam corners Enlow—'Supercollider's dead as a Greek poet'—anonymous hold exposed as Illinois pork grudge.

        Donna unwraps olives in Josh's office, INS notation a bureaucratic bomb. Leo preps Abbey's defiance; she bolts, 'Talk tomorrow.' Bartlet fumes to Leo: 'Your mojo's all over me.' Millgate puffs defiance in Sam's office—'No practical applications, just discovery'—cancer shadows his frenzy, Non-Hodgkins lymphoma ticking.

        Women bond in red room opulence: Abbey, CJ, Amy decant cork-fouled Zinfandel, 'Awasiwi Odinak' Jed's jackass poetry mocked. Donna stumbles in, Canadian exile confessed—'Missed by four miles.' Wine flows; laughter pierces Abbey's armor. 'My career got eaten,' she confesses. CJ patrols dangling modifiers; Amy tallies Medicare wins. Donna blurts: 'You said okay to the drugs.' Silence stings, then dissolves.

        Sam bluffs Enlow with Illinois threats; Millgate schools on X-rays birthed from useless electrons. 'Discovery!' Sam seizes the frame. Enlow folds: 'I'll withdraw the hold.' Toby yields to Marbury—McGann barred. Bartlet refines toast: 'Aren't you glad you didn't marry a ditch digger?' Charlie cuts: 'Do you love her?'

        Cake gleams 'Happy Birthday Abbey.' CJ breaks Nolan news; Abbey masks shock: 'Let's get drunk.' Women raid wine, Donna joins. Josh forgives Amy's end-run: 'Jackass.' Flags rise; 'O Canada' swells—Donna's anthem, grandfathered back via tests. Bartlet confesses calling Nolan—'Rules differ for family.' Abbey shocks: 'I'll forfeit my license for the White House stay.' Love pierces: 'I love you, Jethro.' Glasses clink amid Marbury's cheek-kiss lunge, Leo's birthday cheer. Big band swings as original sin debates—Ireland's shadows, America's interventions—fade into toast untold, resilience forged in festivity's fire.

        President Jed Bartlet barrels through back-to-back TV interviews from the Mural Room, hawking his prime-time energy independence blueprint—hybrid cars, sky-high fuel standards, ditching Saudi oil for innovation. Tension crackles as broadcasters bait him on Ritchie's book pushing Arctic drilling; Bartlet sidesteps until Philly's hot mic betrays him. Off-air, he skewers Ritchie as a '.22 caliber mind in a .357 magnum world,' footage leaks instantly, exploding across networks. Toby grins—pure b-roll gold—but Josh erupts at Sam: amateur hour. CJ vaults into briefings, deploying non-apology apologies: 'Camera was hot, we all slip.' Reporters swarm, Ritchie's camp demands pledges for clean campaigns; CJ parries with Bartlet's credentials, Summa Cum Laude to PhD, while dodging transcript traps.

        Leo briefs Bartlet amid stakeholder pile-ons—unions crave Saudi job kills, polluters beg voluntary rules. GOP lines up House floor whippings for Bartlet's 'impoliteness'; Leo urges skipping rebuttals, letting Dems caucus on real issues. Meanwhile, Josh stumbles into LemonLyman.com, his quirky fan site throbbing with 'Josh Fantasy Dates' and policy nitpicks. Seduced by grassroots fervor, he posts clarifications on GAO powers—backfires spectacularly. Donna warns of hysterics; soon, cyber-mobs crown him ego-lord, Sanskrit-mocking dictator. CJ shoves him out: 'Nurse Ratched's ward—climb the window before lobotomy.' An intern babysits the site.

        Toby woos Tabitha Fortis, freshly minted U.S. Poet Laureate, over her landmine treaty ultimatum. Faxed demands threaten the star-studded dinner; C.J. pushes Sam, but Toby dives in, blank verse flirting amid Korea DMZ minefields—900,000 North Koreans halted by U.S. explosives. Tabitha won't muzzle: '142 signed, we bolted with Cuba.' Sightseeing stalls in D.C. monuments; Toby begs silence at the gala, but she counters with ex-commanders' pleas. At Georgetown lecture, reciting Ginsberg's 'Howl,' she fractures—Banja Luka flashbacks of a boy's Sava River doom. Blank verse fails; truth stumbles. Toby crosses her off his list; she craves private Bartlet ear, 64 couplets queued.

        Sam hustles bipartisanship dodge: promotes firebrand Republican Ainsley Hayes to visible Deputy Counsel, thrusting her on Sunday shows. Ainsley blasts Ivy elitism—Vietnam's Harvard ghosts—versus instinct; Sam demands gravitas, minds at work. '252 million souls; elect both?' Networks balloon to four for Bartlet's Thursday confab. Charlie grills C.J. on ANWR: drill for independence? She unleashes caribou calving horrors, acid rain haze. Bartlet yields House time, pivoting to literacy. Pre-confab, C.J. corners him: green light spotted? Gun metaphors? Bait taken deliberately? Bartlet flashes unreadable steel, strides red carpet amid flashes. Staff scatters; energy destiny hangs. Gaffe transmutes to weapon—Ritchie's intellect now national sport, policy surges unbloodied. Truth slips, spins harden, poets yield, democracy's raw edges gleam.

      title: Stirred
      logline: White House staff secretly debates dumping VP Hoynes amid dire electoral
        math and a radioactive truck crash in Idaho, but Leo's AA anonymity shatters
        as Hoynes reveals decades of sobriety, forcing Bartlet to affirm loyalty over
        political gain.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Dim lights flicker over a circle of weathered faces in a smoke-hazed room, where Leo McGarry sips black coffee, his presence a quiet anchor amid the raw confessions of an AA meeting. John Hoynes bursts in late, commanding instant respect, but murmurs ripple—Leo's public profile risks breaching the sacred veil of anonymity. 'What we see here, what we say here, stays here,' the chair intones, and Hoynes shuts down the dissent: 'My meeting. Leo stays.' Cheers erupt, bonds hold, but cracks spiderweb beneath the surface.

        Across the West Wing's frantic corridors, Thursday night pulses with urgency. Josh Lyman corrals Sam Seaborn, dispatching him to salvage VP Hoynes' cherished Internet Education Act from congressional knives zeroing out its Technology Challenge Fund. Sam balks—'Why me?'—but Josh insists, eyes evasive, guarding the night's true firestorm: a clandestine Roosevelt Room huddle on dumping Hoynes from the ticket. Bruno's electoral calculus chills the air: Texas slips, Florida follows, Ritchie surges. Fitzwallace? Leo himself? Even Grant's ghost haunts the debate, as Toby Ziegler skewers the math, C.J. Cregg probes replacements, tension coils like a live wire.

        Crisis erupts—a 24-ton cask of spent uranium rods from the USS Truman smashes head-on in Idaho's Seven Devils tunnel, flames licking at untested seals, Elk Horn's 20,000 souls twenty miles downwind. Bartlet commandeers Charlie Young's tax return as distraction, bantering Bond martinis and rebates-that-aren't, until C.J. storms in: wire reports scream collision in a ghost stretch of road. National Security scrambles; Fitzwallace, McNally looped in. Is it accident or ambush? The other truck, stolen weeks prior, burns alongside, driver dead—not Arab, just Garry Vernon Clarke. Tunnels blaze hotter than design specs; evacuation looms.

        Subplots ignite like fuses. Donna Moss badgers Josh for a Presidential proclamation honoring her retiring English teacher, Molly Morello—'41 years, Twelfth Night bootlegs!'—Josh stonewalls, proclamations no toys. Toby erupts at HUD Secretary Bill Fisher, freelancing homeownership loans for New Jersey gubernatorial buzz, commandeering the briefing room's cameras. 'One name on the ballot,' Toby snarls, yanking Fisher's spotlight.

        Leo slips in late from AA, pager silent in his pocket, Bartlet ribbing his 'luxury' absence. Radiation holds; shipments halted—one rail cars secured, transuranic convoy beefed up. But the meeting gnaws—Hoynes senses the whispers, confronts Leo: 'Tell the President.' Revelation detonates in the Oval: Hoynes, sober since 22, family history nipping at college heels. Bartlet reels—'You and Bond!'—then pivots: 'Is there anybody left who's not?'

        Hoynes crashes the Roosevelt Room fray, owning the punchline, but math bites: 'I know how to count to 270.' Bartlet scribbles four words—'Because I could die'—thrusting mortality's blade. Hoynes yields the bill's namesake to save it, rural poor be damned. Sam triumphs sans arm-twisting; Toby reels Fisher in.

        Climax surges: Bartlet, magic man incarnate, summons Donna, conjures Morello live on speaker—'Oval Office, because of you.' Tears choke Donna; Morello glows. Tunnel cools, readings nominal—bullet dodged. Hoynes exits fortified, ticket intact. Staff disperses, sobriety's shadows lengthening, loyalty trumping ledgers. Electoral storms brew, but tonight, bonds endure—stirred, not broken. Themes of anonymity's fragility, addiction's quiet wars, and politics' brutal arithmetic resonate, Bartlet's humanism piercing the frenzy: personal inventories amid national peril, amends made in shadowed rooms.

        in Iran's nuclear ambitions threatening a vital summit, shield Press Secretary
        C.J. from death threats sparked by her fiery Saudi critique, and wrestle economic
        fallout from a massive chip recall amid personal and diplomatic reckonings.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Fire engulfs a Saudi girls' school, religious police barricade the doors—seventeen perish because their abayas smolder improperly dressed. C.J. Cregg erupts in the briefing room, unleashing a torrent on America's oil-rich ally: beheadings, beaten women, no rights for half the population. Faxes rage, emails venom-laced with death threats pour in. Donna spots the peril; Josh summons security. Ron Butterfield traces the stalker: photos snap C.J. at home, dining, stalked from twenty feet. Bartlet slams the protection order—sign or else. Reluctant, C.J. yields as Special Agent Simon Donovan materializes, badge glinting, promising peril's perimeter but no guarantees. 'You're being hunted,' he warns, detail locks in.

        Across the bullpen, summit fever grips: Helsinki beckons, Bartlet to clasp hands with reformer Chigorin, NATO expansions whispered—Slovenia, Baltics. Sam Seaborn haggles protocols with Nikolai Ivanovich and George Kozlowski: simultaneous translation to preserve Bartlet's rhetorical rhythm, Hall of Flags over Grand Salon for jet-lagged mercy, overcoat mandate lest Chigorin shiver solo. Russians stonewall, relay to Moscow, but Ivanovich slips nuclear poetry into the joint statement: 'Stem the tide of proliferation... surely once is enough.' Sam smells signal—Chigorin reaches past KGB ghosts.

        Fitzwallace bursts Oval shadows: SR-71 snaps Bushehr reactor, heavy water for plutonium, not Perrier-powered lights. Four intel czars scoff, but no power lines snake out, specs mirror Pakistan's bomb forge. MinAtom starves post-Chernobyl; Iranians twist arms for weapons-grade payoff. Bartlet reels—diplomacy's powder keg. Leo erupts: no Helsinki handshake amid betrayal. Josh probes rogue elements; Leo snaps, Chigorin's clean but powerless. Summit ghosts.

        Toby Ziegler prowls free-scheduled, champions banned reporter Ludmila Koss of Novaya Gazeta—Chigorin foe, apartment-bomber accuser, Defense kid's grades slinger. State snarls: Enquirer at State of Union. Toby retorts, free press demands all comers. Credentials drop, but Toby eviscerates her tabloid stench—yet hands them over.

        Antares crumbles: 80 million chips flawed, Jake Kimball ashen, 98,000 jobs teeter, NASDAQ hemorrhages. Bartlet balks subsidies—economist purity. Leo pleads: one glitch, honorable recall, ripple to tech empires. Bartlet pivots: government stays buyer, Congress bends, no more donations—'screwed by a computer.'

        Charlie Young chases FDR ghost: kid's letter, Pittsburgh budget speech never uttered, private code stamped decades late from razed apartments. Alan Tatum, 89, arrives with son Doc—railroad vet meets idol's heir. Bartlet beams homage, photos flash, stories spill over food.

        Crisis crests: Sam's verse cracks code—Chigorin signals proliferation parley. Bartlet seizes: Helsinki flies, reactor first blood. Staff exhales, coats optional. Donovan shadows C.J. through briefings, perimeter pierced by resolve. Threats loom foreign, foes domestic—White House steels, summit dawns unbroken.

        at Bartlet's MS secret while thwarting a terrorist plot targeting D.C., as
        C.J. battles her protective Secret Service detail and dons a black Vera Wang
        gown that draws a deadly stalker's threat.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Sam Seaborn bursts back into the White House communications bullpen, fresh from Helsinki, clutching a mysterious envelope marked 'personal.' Ginger hands it over with a wink—porn? Inside lurks an opposition attack ad shredding President Bartlet's honor, morality, truth, ripping his face in two, slamming his refusal to sign a clean campaign pledge. No sender, no return address. Sam races it to C.J.'s office, where her new Secret Service shadow, Simon Donovan, brandishes her Mustang's spark plug like a trophy, thwarting her wind-in-hair escape. The ad ignites panic: stolen goods? FBI bait? Bruno Gianelli snarls it's Ritchie's drawer weapon, aimed at Bartlet's concealed MS. Sam pushes to confront Kevin Kahn, Ritchie's campaign emissary, despite unanimous 'no's—trust no one across the aisle.

        Dawn cracks over hallways alive with post-trip banter. Donna Moss squeals at Josh Lyman's crate of sauna-soaked moose meat, a Finnish folly now spiking to $180 on eBay via rogue intern. Josh fumes, Donna defends the unpaid grunts fueling public service's decline. Toby Ziegler clashes with media directors in the Roosevelt Room, their threat to slash convention coverage to bare acceptance speeches and balloons slicing like a trapdoor under losers. Toby erupts—public airwaves demand full spectacle, not infomercial skimps. He dangles antitrust threats, Justice Department shadows looming over joint non-competition.

        Situation Room pulses with dread. Joint Chiefs brief Bartlet: Bahji cells chatter of strikes on Bahrain, Kuwait, Incirlik—Force Protection Delta locks down bases, carriers hug harbors. Intercepts swell the target list to Dover, Fort Myer, the White House itself. Leo McGarry steels Bartlet for bunker descent, combat air patrols over D.C., shoot-down orders on unidentified craft. Bartlet digs in—no coward's hole, even as raids unearth blueprints of National Archives vents, guard counts. Qumari Defense Minister Abdul Shareef's name surfaces in Chechen whispers, Helsinki's fragile peace fracturing.

        C.J. endures Simon's unblinking vigilance, her '65 Mustang gutted of battery, fuel pump, soul. Lunch shopping with niece Hogan at Barney's turns tense: Simon scans coats in May heat, recounts Rosslyn gunfire, his hands forever free. C.J. slips into black silk Vera Wang couture, twirling unwittingly into a stalker's crosshairs. Email awaits: 'You should wear it... because you're going to be dead soon.' Simon slams fist on desk, rage exploding.

        Sam lunches with Kahn at Charlie's, floats monthly emissary meets, shares the tape. Kahn feigns surprise—'We've seen it.' Betrayal erupts: press blasts Sam's pledge push, ad loops free on every channel. Bruno eviscerates: 'You got played.' Rain-lashed confrontation outside Kahn's Dupont Towers—Sam shoves, old open-mic wounds fester, Ritchie's humiliation fueling deceit. All warfare deceives.

        Terror crests then crashes. Coast Guard seizes ammonium nitrate off Oakland, ammonium nitrate aimed at Fort Point's Golden Gate cables—not on lists, but surgically placed. Russians confirm Shareef's hand; diplomatic fury brews for his U.S. visit. Bartlet stands firm—no Marine One, no bunker, resignation threat holstered like a last resort.

        Threads tangle in White House frenzy: assistants muzzle salary gripes, Bruno woos Iowa captains, Toby secures media capitulation. Donna wrangles intern Bruce for $210 moose restitution. C.J. corrects Simon on Hogan's Junior Prom, flinching at aunt-age self-consciousness. Yet peril shadows elegance—the black Vera Wang seals her fate in anonymous venom. Staff hurtles through deception's maze, terror's shadow, campaign knives—honor tested, lives teetering, White House unbreakable under fire.

      logline: President Bartlet confronts a terrorist mastermind masquerading as
        Qumar's Defense Minister, racing against diplomatic immunity and tainted evidence
        to decide between indictment, arrest, or assassination as Shareef jets toward
        American soil.
      high_level_summary: |-
        Intelligence detonates in the Situation Room: Abdul Shareef, Qumar's suave Minister of Defense, bankrolls Bai terrorists behind bombings from Tunisia to Marine barracks. Wires trace $105,000 to Yossi, exploding into $18 million from his dummy corp. Bomb signatures match; his son-in-law flashes in witness photos. Bartlet erupts—'This is Capone!'—demanding Justice indict the ally in sheep's clothing. But proof crumbles: a Chechnyan tortured by Russians. Immunity shields Shareef's Lear jet inbound. Fitzwallace hammers history—Yamamoto's plane plummets in WWII payback—urging targeted kill before pregnant bombers birth more death.

        Leo resists, clinging to law's iron spine, but Bartlet wavers on morality's razor edge. 'Moral absolutes,' he insists, yet Leo slices back: village idiot trumps Nobel in kill-or-be-killed math. Shareef lands; options ignite. Bartlet greenlights the jet, eyes steel.

        Parallel fires rage. Josh dances with Amy's stew and fury over welfare reauthorization. Pintero dangles 25 votes for $300 million marriage incentives—'horse manure,' Bartlet snorts, but swallows for childcare billions. Amy sabotages: phone cords snipped, cell drowned in gravy, rallying women's caucus against 'loveless' bribes conjuring 'Leave It to Beaver.' Telegrams avalanche two-to-one against; Bartlet blisters Josh—'Sorry doesn't get 218!'—trapped in Broadway's glare with rival Ritchie, church ties unyielding.

        Donna braves Bismarck blizzards, stonewalling North Dakota's 'drop north' plea—'42 inches snow won't melt with rebrand'—delivering Josh's brush-off amid flat-earth gripes. Sam shakes sex-tape ghosts; Toby goads rage over Everglades gambit, flipping sugar subsidies into $8 billion restore, forcing Ritchie's Florida defense. 'Blood enemy,' Toby craves; Sam surges, memo blazing.

        CJ flirts lethal with Simon—gym sweat to .357 recoil slamming her floorward, his three bull's-eyes clinch 'you're tall, makes me feminine.' Rosslyn scars surface: he drops the 15-year-old shooter. Kiss teeters, duty diverges. Charlie hunts Mrs. Landingham's heir, X-factor haunting; Bartlet mourns yearly at grave, shrink confessions whispered to stone.

        Tensions coil: Ritchie fundraiser pulls White House into five-hour Shakespeare roast; welfare vote clashes Catholic fealty. Bartlet blasts schedulers—'cattle call in the Presidential Box!'—as Amy phone-banks Bible Belt on limp abstinence. Midnight Oval showdown: Leo storms at 1 a.m., 'cancel shreds options; war demands Shareef's end.' Bartlet yields, dialing State—no reversal, just calculated peril.

        Threads converge in moral quake. Assassination precedents—Yamamoto, Bonhoeffer—shatter peacetime illusions. Fitzwallace mourns blurred wars: heralds obsolete, nature's laws gutted. Bartlet, erudite agonizer, pivots from absolutes to survival calculus. Team fractures, reforms: Josh eyes Amy's warpath, Sam re-arms fury, CJ tastes gunpowder romance. Stakes pulse—innocents hang on one man's call amid terror's shadow, election's grind, personal salvos. Fade to black: Shareef flies on, doom uncoiling.

        Chaos erupts in the briefing room as C.J. juggles press jabs about a delayed presidential trip to New York for a marathon Shakespeare play, casually dropping the bombshell of a last-minute huddle with Qumari Defense Minister Abdul Shareef—unwittingly igniting the episode's molten core. Cut to the Situation Room, where Leo and Joint Chiefs corner Bartlet: Shareef bankrolls assassins targeting Americans, but Posse Comitatus chains the military, Executive Orders ban political hits, and U.S. soil shields him. Fitzwallace blueprints a shadow op—hijack Shareef's Gulfstream mid-flight, force-land in Bermuda, snipers waiting in the grass. Bartlet recoils, clutching a poisoned-gift pen recorder, his unease a live wire as he storms out, morality clashing against necessity's blade.

        Parallel fires rage. Josh claws for welfare reform votes, trading marriage incentives and childcare billions with fence-sitters, Amy's principled rebellion forcing dirty deals like platform-chair bribes that sour victory's taste. Charlie hunts Delores Landingham's replacement, landing alpaca-farming ex-staffer Debbie Fiderer—stoned, sassy, fired once before for shielding him—her chaotic charm cracking Bartlet's resolve into reluctant pursuit. C.J. spars with Secret Service hunk Simon Donovan, their flirtation exploding in a New York alley kiss after his team nabs her stalker, only for fate to gun him down in a bodega shootout, bullets ripping through stolen tenderness as 'Hallelujah' wails.

        New York pulses: motorcades snarl, Ritchie skips the play for Yankees baseball, Toby and Sam unleash traffic-jamming revenge, stranding the rival governor in gridlock retribution. Welfare squeaks through by eight, but Josh's guilt festers—he bought votes, betrayed ideals. Intermission shadows deepen Bartlet's torment; Leo presses with victim lists and monkish pleas: 'You won.' Bartlet snaps, 'Take him,' greenlighting snipers who drop Shareef and guards on Bermuda dirt, recorder salvaged as proof bleeds out.

        Theater swells with 'Victorious in war shall be made glorious in peace,' Bartlet's silhouette looms behind curtains, peace a hollow echo. Ritchie confronts him post-bathroom cigarette—'Crime? Boy, I don't know' seals ass-kicking destiny. Simon's corpse sprawls amid bodega flowers, C.J. weeps in Times Square neon, Amy quits over welfare's compromises, Josh haunted by pragmatism's cost. Bartlet watches the stage, victory's chorus masking assassination's stain, reelection looming like war clouds over Qumar. Power demands descent into ordinary nations' league, morality's armor shatters under stakes' unyielding crush—extraordinary men forge peace through targeted savagery, personal griefs underscoring isolation's throne. Thematic thunder rolls: leadership's lone savagery, where winning means losing pieces of soul, legal fig leaves torn away by terror's blade, and even presidents bleed human.
