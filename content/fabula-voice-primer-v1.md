## 1. What This Primer Is

This is a practical guide to writing in the Fabula marketing voice — the voice that sells a narrative knowledge graph to entertainment professionals, technical evaluators, and investors through web copy, email, Substack, and conversation.

It is not a guide to the Fabula product voice (UI copy, error messages, onboarding flows), the catalog voice (entity descriptions, relationship labels, graph annotations), or the Substack voice (long-form thinking about narrative intelligence). Those are adjacent registers with their own requirements, covered briefly in Section 11.

The marketing voice has one job: make the case that stories are knowledge graphs, that the entertainment industry's current tools are architecturally wrong, and that Fabula is the first system that gets it right. Everything in this primer serves that job.

The structural foundations here are adapted from the print advertising voice of Infocom (1982–1986), whose campaign for interactive fiction is the clearest precedent for what Fabula needs to do: sell an intellectually ambitious product to a literate audience by trusting their intelligence and prosecuting a sustained argument. The principles are transferable. The application is our own.

---

## 2. The One Strategic Argument

Every Fabula marketing execution, across every page, every email, and every Substack post, serves one strategic argument:

> **Stories are knowledge graphs. The entertainment industry manages them as documents. This is architecturally wrong, and we built the thing that's right.**

This is the permanent brand position. It is Fabula's equivalent of Infocom's "prose is superior to graphics." Understanding it is prerequisite to understanding everything else about the voice, because every creative choice — tone, structure, humour, evidence selection — exists to advance this single case.

### The Argument in Practice

The underlying logic is always the same: (a) the entertainment industry creates the most complex narrative structures in human culture; (b) it manages those structures with spreadsheets, wikis, PDFs, and memory — tools that cannot represent relationships, traverse temporal boundaries, or answer graph questions; (c) Fabula replaces these tools with a knowledge graph that understands narrative structure the way databases understand transactions; (d) therefore Fabula is the first tool worthy of the content it serves.

The argument can be prosecuted from many angles. The homepage prosecutes it through the absurdity of the status quo ("Your Story Bible Is Fiction"). The About page prosecutes it through narrative theory (fabula/syuzhet, Genette, dual temporal indices). The For Production page prosecutes it through accumulated professional pain. The Benchmarks page prosecutes it through validated evidence. The Platform page prosecutes it through architectural specificity. But the case is always the same case.

### The Strategic Principle

You are never simply advertising a product. You are prosecuting a case for the supremacy of graphs over documents as the infrastructure for narrative. Every headline, every paragraph, every evidence selection should advance that case — directly, obliquely, or by demonstration. If an execution doesn't serve this argument, it doesn't belong in the campaign.

## 3. The Audience: Who the Voice Is Talking To

The Fabula voice addresses two primary audiences and one secondary audience. They are different people with different needs, but they share critical traits that make a single voice possible.

### The Hollywood Professional

Showrunners, writers, script supervisors, development executives, producers, and production coordinators. They create and manage complex narrative at scale. They are smart, literate, and professionally frustrated by inadequate tools. They do not think of themselves as technology buyers. They think of themselves as storytellers who are drowning in logistics.

This audience responds to: recognition of their specific pain, respect for their craft, confidence that you understand their workflow, and demonstrations that feel like their world rather than a tech pitch. They will not read jargon. They will read five hundred words about the writers' room silence when nobody remembers Season 2.

### The Technical Evaluator

Investors, CTOs, technical founders, and AI engineers assessing the architecture. They want to understand the system's defensibility, scalability, and differentiation. They are comfortable with technical specificity and will be suspicious of vagueness.

This audience responds to: architectural precision, honest benchmarks, named technologies (Neo4j, ChromaDB, BAML), competitive positioning against real alternatives (Netflix EKG, Notion templates), and evidence of engineering discipline. They appreciate confidence. They distrust hype.

### The Narratologist (Secondary)

Academics, researchers, and narrative theory enthusiasts who care about computational narratology, knowledge representation, and the fabula/syuzhet distinction. This is a small audience, but they are disproportionately influential — they write about us, cite us, and validate our intellectual foundations.

This audience responds to: theoretical precision, historical depth, correct attribution (Genette, the Russian formalists), and the sense that we take narrative theory as seriously as they do.

### The Shared Trait

All three audiences are **readers**. They are comfortable with complex sentences, appreciate wit, and respond to intellectual respect. The voice assumes a reader who will parse a double meaning in a headline, read sustained prose, and be persuaded by argument rather than spectacle. This assumption of intelligence is not a tonal choice — it is the strategic foundation of the entire voice.

Any execution that talks down, oversimplifies, or substitutes enthusiasm for argument has misidentified the audience.

---

## 4. The Competitive Foil: The Spreadsheet

Every good argument needs something to argue against. Infocom argued against pixel-based graphics — specifically, the crude, blocky sprites of early arcade games. Their foil was visible, mockable, and immediately recognisable to every member of the audience.

Fabula's foil is **the spreadsheet**. More precisely: the entire document-based infrastructure that the entertainment industry uses to manage narrative — Google Sheets story bibles, Confluence wikis, PDF character guides, Final Draft annotations, binders, whiteboards, and the script coordinator's memory.

### Why the Spreadsheet Works as a Foil

**It's universal.** Every production professional has a spreadsheet story bible. Every writers' room has a wiki that was accurate in February. The foil doesn't need explanation.

**It's absurd when you look at it.** The entertainment industry generates billions of dollars in IP value. It manages that IP in the same software a dentist uses to track appointments. The juxtaposition is inherently comic.

**It's architecturally wrong in a way you can demonstrate.** A spreadsheet can list characters. A wiki can describe them. But neither can answer "which characters have scenes with both the President and the First Lady, and how did those relationships change after the MS scandal?" That's a graph operation. The foil isn't just inferior — it's categorically incapable.

**It's not a competitor.** We're not attacking another company's product. We're attacking a *category of tool*. This is safer, broader, and more durable than competitive positioning against a specific rival.

### The Foil in Practice

The spreadsheet should appear in Fabula copy the way arcade sprites appeared in Infocom ads: as evidence of the problem, not as a target of contempt. The tone is bemused, not hostile. We're not angry that the industry uses spreadsheets. We're amazed that it still does. The humour comes from the gap between the complexity of the content and the poverty of the tool.

Specific, concrete references are always stronger than generic ones. Don't say "inadequate tools." Say "Google Sheets with tabs for each season." Don't say "manual processes." Say "the script coordinator reading every script cover to cover because Legal needs the asset list by EOD." The foil earns its power through specificity.

## 5. Headline Construction: The Provocative Reversal

The Fabula headline is not a tagline, a description, or a benefit statement. It is a provocation. It creates cognitive dissonance — a statement that reads as negative, alarming, or absurd — which the body copy then resolves into the strategic argument. This mechanic is the single most distinctive and repeatable element of the voice.

### The Mechanic

**Phase 1: The Hook.** The headline presents a statement that appears to undermine the brand, confess a weakness, or insult the reader's current practice. The reader's instinct is to think, "Wait, did they really just say that?"

**Phase 2: The Turn.** The first sentence or two of body copy reframes the headline, revealing the second meaning. The cognitive dissonance resolves, and the reader experiences a small intellectual reward for having continued reading.

**Phase 3: The Argument.** Having earned the reader's attention and goodwill, the copy proceeds to make the sustained case.

### Annotated Examples

**"Your Story Bible Is Fiction."**

*Surface reading:* You're insulting my work product.

*Resolved reading:* The stories are fiction. The bible itself should be fact — but a document with no verification mechanism and no self-updating capability isn't a source of truth. It's an act of faith.

*Why it works:* The word "fiction" does triple duty — it's pejorative (unreliable), descriptive (the genre), and domain-specific (the audience makes fiction). The resolution flatters the reader: you're smart enough to see the absurdity of managing 726 characters in a spreadsheet.

**"How to Lose the Plot."**

*Surface reading:* A self-help parody about going crazy.

*Resolved reading:* A literal description of what happens when you manage narrative complexity in documents. You lose the plot — the actual plot of your show.

*Why it works:* The idiom and the literal meaning are both true simultaneously. Both readings advance the strategic argument.

### Construction Principles

**The headline must be legible as a complete, self-contained statement.** It should make grammatical and logical sense on its own, even before the body copy resolves it.

**The surface reading should create friction.** It should appear to confess, provoke, or challenge. The reader should feel a small dissonance — "that can't be right" — that motivates them to keep reading.

**The resolution must be clean and immediate.** The turn from surface to resolved meaning should happen in the first one or two sentences of body copy. If you need a paragraph to explain the joke, the headline doesn't work.

**The resolved meaning must advance the core strategic argument.** The reversal isn't wordplay for its own sake — it always resolves into some version of "graphs are better than documents" or "Fabula treats your stories with the seriousness they deserve."

**Domain-specific double meanings are gold.** The Fabula voice operates in a domain — storytelling, narrative production — that is rich with words that carry both technical and colloquial meanings. "Plot," "fiction," "character," "arc," "story," "script," "scene." When a headline can make a word work in both its narrative-domain sense and its everyday sense, the audience feels the insider pleasure of recognising both. This is the equivalent of Infocom's "All words. No pictures" — a phrase that is literally true (the product contains words and no pictures) and rhetorically powerful (it's a proud declaration of the brand position).

### Headlines to Avoid

**Benefit statements.** "Never Lose Track of Your Story Again" is a promise, not a provocation. It tells the reader what the product does instead of earning their attention. It's the language of SaaS marketing, not the language of argumentation.

**Pain-point quotes.** "Wait, Did We Already Do That?" empathises with the reader's frustration. Empathy is the opening move of SaaS copy. The Fabula voice doesn't empathise — it diagnoses. It tells you *why* you're frustrated, not that it understands your frustration.

**Category labels.** "The Context Engine for Narrative Production" defines Fabula by its category. This is the Personal Software error — marketing by category rather than by argument.

---

## 6. Body Copy Architecture: The Sustained Argument

Fabula body copy follows a five-part architecture:

**Part 1: Resolution of the Headline.** The first one or two sentences resolve the provocative reversal, rewarding the reader for engaging. This must be fast and clean.

**Part 2: The Product Argument.** A sustained case for Fabula, built around the contrast between graph infrastructure and document-based tools. This is the largest portion of the copy. It occupies paragraphs, not bullet points.

**Part 3: The Evidence.** Specific demonstrations — a character's graph trace, a query result, a BDI model excerpt, a temporal traversal. The evidence should let the reader *experience* the product on the page, the way Infocom's Hitchhiker's ad reproduced actual game output.

**Part 4: The Call to Action.** A direct invitation, typically to explore the live catalog or register for early access.

**Part 5: The Closing Mantra.** The brand signature (see Section 9).

### Pacing and Paragraph Length

Fabula body copy uses moderate paragraphs — three to five sentences. The rhythm is conversational rather than essayistic. Read the copy aloud: it should sound like a smart, slightly conspiratorial colleague explaining why the industry's infrastructure is broken and why your team should care, not like a product brochure or a pitch deck.

### The Argumentative Pivot

Most Fabula copy should contain a moment where the prose pivots from general claims to specific evidence. This is often signalled by a direct example: "Consider what a showrunner actually manages..." or "Fabula knows that Toby Ziegler's ex-wife appears in four episodes across two seasons..." This pivot matters because it shifts the reader from being told to being shown. The copy becomes the product for a few seconds. That is the most powerful selling technique available to a narrative intelligence system.

### Prose, Not Grids

The Fabula voice makes its arguments in prose — paragraphs, sentences, sustained chains of reasoning. Not bullet points. Not feature grids. Not stat callouts.

This is a structural commitment, not a formatting preference. Feature grids signal "we know you won't read this, so here are the highlights." Prose signals "we trust you to engage." The medium is the message: if you're selling a system that understands the structure of narrative, your marketing copy should itself be well-structured narrative. A page full of cards and callout numbers is a spreadsheet by another name — the very thing we're arguing against.

Numbers and stats are welcome, but they should appear as details *within* arguments, not as freestanding callouts. "87 milliseconds" is more powerful as the punchline of a paragraph demonstrating five different graph queries against one character than as a number in a stats block.

---

## 7. Compression and Implied Vastness

Fabula copy shares a critical quality with good screenwriting: it implies a world larger than what it explicitly describes. This is achieved through deliberate specificity — using concrete, particular details to gesture at systems and capabilities that exist beyond the frame.

### The Mechanism

**Favour specific details over general claims.** Don't say "726 canonical entities." Say "seven hundred characters — from the President of the United States to the bartender who appeared once in a cold open and might come back in Season 5." The range from protagonist to near-invisible guest implies the completeness of the system. The reader infers 726; you didn't have to announce it.

**Let one example carry the weight of the whole system.** "Mrs. Landingham was mentioned in three episodes before she appeared on screen" is one graph query result. The paragraph that follows shows temporal analysis, relationship tracking, emotional arc mapping, and cross-episode aggregation — five different capabilities, demonstrated through a single character. Then "This is one character out of 726" lets the reader multiply.

**Use domain-specific details that imply professional knowledge.** "Final Draft, Fountain, PDF" tells a production professional that we know their workflow. "The script coordinator reading every script cover to cover" tells them we've been in their office. These details aren't features — they're signals of credibility that compress pages of explanation into a few words.

**Trust the reader to fill in gaps.** The audience is smart and professionally experienced. They don't need every implication spelled out. When you describe one character's graph trace in rich detail, the reader understands that *every* character has a comparable trace. You don't need to say so. Saying so insults them.

### The Anti-Pattern

The opposite of compression is exhaustive enumeration — listing every feature, every capability, every stat. Enumeration is the language of product specification sheets. It signals anxiety: *please believe us, look at all these things we do.* Compression signals confidence: *here is one thing. Infer the rest.*

## 8. The Tonal Register: The Intelligent Friend

The Fabula marketing voice is **The Intelligent Friend**. It trusts the reader. It assumes they are smart, professional, and currently underserved by their tools. Its posture is not "you're doing it wrong" but "you deserve better infrastructure." It flatters the reader's intelligence while making a promise: this is the system worthy of your content.

### What the Voice Is

**Confident.** The voice knows what it built and why it matters. It doesn't hedge, qualify, or apologise for its ambitions. "We didn't build a better story bible. We built what a story bible should have been all along." Confidence is earned through specificity — the voice can be confident because it can cite evidence.

**Conspiratorial.** The voice shares a secret with the reader: the industry's tools are absurdly inadequate, and we both know it. The humour comes from this shared recognition. "The most complex narratives in human culture are managed in Google Sheets" is funny because it's true, and both writer and reader know it's true.

**Precise.** The voice uses specific details, named technologies, concrete examples, and exact numbers. Precision is how you earn the right to be confident. Vague claims ("state-of-the-art extraction") undermine the voice. Precise claims ("90.2% entity extraction accuracy validated against human annotation with 96.3% inter-annotator agreement") reinforce it.

**Intellectually generous.** The voice assumes the reader can follow complex arguments, understand narrative theory, and appreciate architectural decisions. It explains things not because the reader is ignorant but because the explanation itself is interesting. The About page's discussion of fabula and syuzhet isn't dumbing down for the audience — it's sharing intellectual enthusiasm with peers.

### What the Voice Is Not

**Not empathetic-first.** SaaS marketing leads with empathy: "We understand your pain." The Fabula voice leads with diagnosis: "Here's why you have that pain, and it's not your fault — it's an infrastructure failure." The distinction matters. Empathy positions the brand as a helper. Diagnosis positions the brand as an authority.

**Not adversarial.** The voice does not test, challenge, or doubt the reader. It does not adopt a Dungeon Master posture ("can you handle this?"). It assumes the reader is already worthy of the product. The challenge is in the infrastructure, not in the audience.

**Not breathless.** The voice does not use exclamation points, hyperbolic adjectives ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "unprecedented"), or startup enthusiasm. It makes its case with evidence and argument, not with energy. If the evidence is compelling, the excitement follows. If it isn't, no amount of enthusiasm will compensate.

**Not apologetic.** The voice never apologises for the product's complexity, ambition, or intellectual foundations. Infocom never apologised for being text-only — they declared it a strength. Fabula never apologises for requiring narrative theory to explain its architecture — that theory is the product's deepest differentiator.

---

## 9. The Closing Mantra

Across all marketing executions, Fabula copy closes with a recurring passage that functions as both brand signature and philosophical statement:

> **All edges. No spreadsheets. Your story's structure has always been a graph. Now you can see it.**

This is not a slogan or a tagline. It is a closing ritual — a piece of language that signals the end of the argument and restates the brand's core promise.

### Anatomy of the Mantra

**"All edges. No spreadsheets."** restates the brand position in the most compressed possible form. Four words. The period after each phrase gives them staccato finality — this is not apologetic; it is declarative. The structure mirrors Infocom's "All words. No pictures." The word "edges" is technically precise (edges are the relationships in a graph) and metaphorically resonant (the edge of something new, the cutting edge). "No spreadsheets" names the foil.

**"Your story's structure has always been a graph."** shifts from the rational to the romantic. The argument has been made; now the close appeals to recognition and inevitability. The claim is not that we invented something new — it's that we revealed something that was always true. Your story was always a web of relationships. The tools just couldn't show you.

**"Now you can see it."** Four words. Present tense. Direct address. The product is the revelation. The reader is the beneficiary.

### Variations

The mantra should appear consistently on every page, but individual executions may adapt it when the context requires. The Substack might close with: "All edges. No spreadsheets. More soon." The catalog might close with: "All edges. No spreadsheets. This is what your show looks like as a graph." These variations should preserve the "All edges. No spreadsheets." declaration and adjust only the closing promise.

---

## 10. The Lexicon: Brand Furniture

The Fabula marketing voice employs a consistent vocabulary of recurring terms that reinforce the brand identity.

### Terms We Use

**"Context engine."** The primary product category. Not "story bible tool," not "AI extraction platform," not "narrative database." A context engine — a system that creates, maintains, and serves narrative context at production scale. This is our "interactive fiction" — by naming the category, we own it.

**"Knowledge graph."** The architectural foundation, used when speaking to technical audiences. A knowledge graph is a specific, understood data structure. Using the term precisely positions Fabula in an established technical tradition.

**"Story bible that updates itself."** The translation for Hollywood audiences. When "knowledge graph" would be jargon, this phrase communicates the same value proposition in production language. The key word is "itself" — it distinguishes Fabula from every manual process.

**"All edges. No spreadsheets."** The brand declaration. Use it as a closing mantra, a section divider, a standalone statement. It is proud, not apologetic.

**"Lose the plot."** Available as a recurring motif — the double meaning (go crazy / literally lose the narrative structure) is ours to deploy whenever the copy needs a moment of levity that serves the argument.

**"Zero drift."** The precision claim. Entity drift is the specific, named failure mode of document-based story bibles — characters changing attributes, relationships becoming inconsistent, facts contradicting themselves across episodes. "Zero drift" is our "zero defects." It names the problem and claims the solution in two words.

### Terms We Avoid

**"AI-powered."** Generic, meaningless, and positions us in a crowded category rather than a unique one. Every product is "AI-powered" in 2025. Fabula uses AI; it is not defined by it.

**"Revolutionary / game-changing / unprecedented."** Hyperbolic adjectives that substitute enthusiasm for evidence. If the product is revolutionary, the evidence will make that clear. The word itself is noise.

**"Players" and game-culture language.** The Hollywood audience are not players, users, or gamers. They are showrunners, writers, coordinators, and executives. They are professionals who make stories. Address them as such.

**"Solution."** The enterprise-software word for "product when you don't want to say product." It communicates nothing and signals SaaS-speak. Fabula is a context engine, a knowledge graph, an infrastructure layer. Never a solution.

**"Leverage / utilise / synergy."** Corporate language that signals a voice talking *at* the reader rather than *with* them. The Fabula voice is conversational, precise, and human. If you wouldn't say it to a smart colleague over coffee, don't write it.

---

## 11. The Four Registers

Fabula operates in four distinct voices. They share values — intelligence, precision, respect for the reader — but they differ in posture, audience, and purpose. Confusing them is the most common voice error.

### The Marketing Voice (this primer)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Audience** | Prospect — hasn't committed yet |
| **Posture** | The Intelligent Friend making a case |
| **Purpose** | Prosecute the strategic argument |
| **Humour** | Conspiratorial — shared recognition of absurdity |
| **Trust level** | Trusts reader's intelligence, cannot assume product familiarity |
| **Where it lives** | Website, pitch materials, launch emails, conference talks |

### The Substack Voice

| | |
|---|---|
| **Audience** | Reader — already interested, following the thinking |
| **Posture** | The Researcher sharing findings |
| **Purpose** | Build intellectual credibility and demonstrate depth |
| **Humour** | Dry, self-aware, occasionally self-deprecating about the work |
| **Trust level** | Trusts reader's intelligence, assumes some product familiarity |
| **Where it lives** | Substack posts, technical blog entries |

The Substack voice is more personal, more exploratory, and more willing to show the process — including failures, wrong turns, and open questions. It's the newsletter register: insider, behind-the-scenes, rewarding engagement. If the marketing voice says "90.2% entity extraction accuracy," the Substack voice says "here's the month we spent getting from 74% to 90%, and here's what we learned about why the last 10% is the hardest."

### The Catalog Voice

| | |
|---|---|
| **Audience** | Explorer — browsing the live demo |
| **Posture** | The Reference Librarian |
| **Purpose** | Present graph data with clarity and navigability |
| **Humour** | Minimal — precision over personality |
| **Trust level** | Assumes product familiarity (they're already in the catalog) |
| **Where it lives** | Entity descriptions, relationship labels, UI copy, search results |

The catalog voice is the quietest register. It's the voice of the product itself — clean, factual, well-organised. It should feel like a well-curated reference work, not like marketing copy. When a user reads a character description in the catalog, they should feel they're consulting a canonical source, not being sold to.

### The Early Access Voice

| | |
|---|---|
| **Audience** | Applicant — interested enough to register |
| **Posture** | The Club Welcoming a New Member |
| **Purpose** | Convert interest into registration, segment by role |
| **Humour** | Warm, collegial, slightly exclusive |
| **Trust level** | High — they navigated to a registration page |
| **Where it lives** | Early access page, confirmation emails, onboarding |

This is the newsletter register adapted for conversion. The reader is already interested. The voice should feel like an invitation to a conversation, not a transactional form. The confirmation ("Thanks! We'll be in touch.") should feel like the beginning of a relationship, not the end of a funnel.

---

## 12. The Domain Advantage: Narrative as Rhetoric

Fabula has a structural advantage that most technology companies don't: the product's domain is also the voice's rhetorical toolkit. We sell narrative infrastructure using the tools of narrative — story structure, character, arc, metaphor, compression, payoff.

### Exploit This

**Use narrative structure in the copy itself.** The homepage hero builds tension (the accumulating clauses about the story bible's inadequacy), reaches a crisis ("that's an act of faith"), delivers a turn ("And faith... is how you lose the plot. Literally."), and resolves ("Fabula is the context engine that replaces faith with structure"). This is dramatic structure applied to marketing prose. The reader feels the shape of a story even if they don't consciously identify it.

**Use the product's own terminology as metaphor.** "Zero drift" is a technical term for entity consistency, but it also describes the voice itself — disciplined, precise, no wandering from the argument. "Dual temporal indices" describes the architecture, but the concept of two timelines (what actually happened vs. how the story was told) is itself a narrative device the copy can use. The product's language is rich enough to carry both technical and rhetorical weight.

**Demonstrate, don't describe.** The product's core capability is making narrative structure visible and queryable. The copy should do the same thing — make the structure of the argument visible, make the evidence queryable (by linking to the live catalog), and show the reader what a well-structured piece of prose looks like. If the copy itself is a knowledge graph of claims, evidence, and connections, it demonstrates the product's value before the reader reaches the CTA.

**Let the shows do the work.** We process real television — The West Wing, Star Trek TNG, Doctor Who. These are beloved, complex, well-known properties. A single specific detail from one of these shows ("Mrs. Landingham was mentioned in three episodes before she appeared on screen") carries more persuasive power than any amount of abstract description. The reader already cares about these characters. Show them what the graph knows, and the product sells itself.

---

## 13. The Anti-Case Study: What the Voice Is Not

The most instructive examples of what the Fabula voice is not come from the surrounding marketing landscape.

### The SaaS Product Page

Feature grids. Benefit bullets. "Trusted by 10,000+ teams." Pricing tiers with checkmarks. This is marketing by enumeration — listing what the product does instead of arguing why it matters. It assumes a reader who is comparing features across competitors, not a reader who can be persuaded by a case.

The Fabula voice rejects this grammar. Not because feature grids are bad, but because they serve a different kind of product. Feature grids work when the category is established and the buyer is choosing between known alternatives. Fabula is defining a new category. You can't compare it on a feature grid because nothing else occupies the same row.

### The AI Hype Voice

"Revolutionary AI-powered platform that leverages cutting-edge large language models to transform your workflow." Every word here is noise. "Revolutionary" is an unearned claim. "AI-powered" is a category label. "Leverages" is a non-verb. "Cutting-edge" is a dead metaphor. "Transform" is a promise without evidence.

The Fabula voice earns every claim with evidence and never uses a word that could apply to any other product. If you can swap in another company's name and the sentence still works, the sentence is too generic.

### The Empathy-First SaaS Voice

"We know how frustrating it is to manage complex narratives with inadequate tools. That's why we built Fabula." This is SaaS therapy-voice: it leads with emotional validation and positions the product as a remedy for the reader's suffering.

The Fabula voice doesn't empathise. It diagnoses. "The entertainment industry creates the most complex narrative structures in human culture. It manages them in Google Sheets." That's not empathy — it's an observation that reframes the reader's frustration as an architectural failure. The reader's problem isn't emotional. It's infrastructural. The distinction drives everything.

### The Personal Software Test

Adapted from Infocom's diagnostic: Does any element of this execution market by category rather than by argument? Does it describe the product as a "tool" or "platform" instead of prosecuting the case for graphs over documents? Does it fail to trust the audience's intelligence? Does it substitute enthusiasm for evidence? If yes to any, revise.

---

## 14. Diagnostic Checklist

Before finalising any execution, verify:

**Strategic alignment.** Does this execution advance the core argument that stories are knowledge graphs and documents are architecturally wrong?

**Audience calibration.** Does the copy assume an intelligent, literate, professionally experienced audience? Would a showrunner feel respected? Would a technical evaluator feel informed? Would a narratologist feel engaged?

**Headline mechanics.** Does the headline use the provocative reversal? Does the surface reading create friction? Does the resolution happen within the first two sentences of body copy?

**Body copy architecture.** Does the copy follow the five-part structure (Resolution → Argument → Evidence → Call to Action → Closing Mantra)? Is there a clear pivot from claims to evidence? Is the argument made in prose, not bullet points?

**Compression.** Does the copy use specific details to imply larger systems, rather than making general claims? Is there at least one concrete example from a real show?

**Tonal register.** Is the voice The Intelligent Friend — confident, conspiratorial, precise? Not empathetic-first? Not adversarial? Not breathless?

**Competitive foil.** Does the spreadsheet (or its equivalents) appear as the foil? Is the contrast clear without being hostile?

**Closing mantra.** Does the execution close with "All edges. No spreadsheets." or a justified variation?

**Brand furniture.** Does the execution use the established lexicon? No "AI-powered," no "solution," no "revolutionary"?

**The Personal Software test.** Does any element market by category rather than by argument? Does it describe what the product isn't rather than what it is? Does it fail to trust the audience? If yes to any, revise.

**The demonstration test.** Does the copy, at any point, become the product for a few seconds — showing a graph query result, a character trace, a BDI model excerpt — so the reader experiences what Fabula does rather than being told about it? If not, find a place to demonstrate.

*Fabula*

*All edges. No spreadsheets. Your story's structure has always been a graph. Now you can see it.*
