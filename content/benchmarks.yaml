# Benchmarks Page — v2 Voice Primer Rewrite
# ============================================
#
# V2 PRIMER ASSIGNMENTS:
# Unique thesis: Validated numbers as evidence. The willingness
#   to publish is itself the argument.
# Signature show: The West Wing (methodology focus — the test
#   material, not the narrative demonstration)
# Signature demonstration: Inter-annotator agreement methodology
# Emotional movement: Challenge → evidence → precision → bridge
#
# COMPETITIVE FOIL (this page's instance):
# Self-reported metrics. Vendor demos on cherry-picked inputs.
# "AI-powered" claims with no validation methodology.
#
# RHYTHMIC MODES USED:
# Hero: Sustained argument
# Accuracy tables: Sustained argument (appropriate for precision)
# Scale section: Staccato confession (the honesty about 90.2%)
# Methodology: Sustained argument with playful double-take headlines
# CTA: Magnanimous declaration
#
# V1 → V2 CHANGES:
# - Scale section restructured. V1 was a prose paragraph weaving
#   numbers in. V2 opens with a staccato confession about what
#   we don't extract, then builds to what we do. The honesty
#   moment earns trust before the numbers land.
# - 726 is correctly here as primary home per v2 primer.
# - "87ms" appears in the performance table — this is its
#   co-primary home alongside the homepage's compressed reference.
# - Footer mantra already varied. Refined.
# - Methodology section: already uses playful double-take
#   headline ("We Still Made Them Argue"). Good. Preserved.

    Every metric on this page was validated against human annotation&mdash;not
    self-reported, not cherry-picked, not measured on a dataset we designed to
    make ourselves look good. Two independent annotators reviewed the same material
    and agreed with each other 96.3% of the time. Then we measured Fabula against
    their consensus. That&rsquo;s how you build a benchmark you can defend in a
    room full of people who read scripts for a living and engineers who read
    architecture docs the same way.

    All benchmarks measured on <em>The West Wing</em> seasons 1&ndash;4, validated
    by independent human annotators with 96.3% inter-annotator agreement.

    intro: >
      The first question everyone asks, and the one most vendors answer with
      a demo on their best example. Here are validated numbers across the full
      dataset&mdash;the ambiguous scenes, the walk-on characters, the cold opens
      that don&rsquo;t name anyone for three pages. Framed for both the people
      who make television and the people who evaluate infrastructure.
    metrics:
      - metric: "Entity Extraction Accuracy"
        result: "90.2%"
        hollywood_meaning: "Nine out of ten characters, locations, and objects extracted automatically. You review the genuinely ambiguous tenth&mdash;not the nine we missed."
        investor_meaning: "Hallucination rate below noise floor. Human-in-loop adjudication handles genuine ambiguity, not systemic extraction failures."
      - metric: "Relationship Precision"
        result: "94.7%"
        hollywood_meaning: "Who talked to whom, who works for whom, who betrayed whom&mdash;correctly mapped across four seasons without manual curation."
        investor_meaning: "Typed edges maintain semantic accuracy across temporal boundaries. Graph connectivity is high-signal, low-noise at production scale."
      - metric: "Temporal Ordering Accuracy"
        result: "98.1%"
        hollywood_meaning: "Flashbacks, cold opens, non-linear timelines&mdash;correctly sequenced. Near-perfect timeline construction from scripts alone."
        investor_meaning: "Dual temporal index architecture validates at research-grade accuracy. Fabula/syuzhet separation handles narrative complexity the way narratologists intended."

    intro: >
      Speed matters in a writers&rsquo; room where momentum is currency and
      every pause to look something up costs the pitch that was forming in
      someone&rsquo;s head. Speed also matters when you&rsquo;re evaluating
      whether infrastructure can scale past a single show.
    metrics:
      - metric: "Query Latency (Avg)"
        result: "87ms"
        hollywood_meaning: "Ask any question about your show&mdash;who was in that scene, what happened after, where it took place&mdash;and the answer arrives before the room moves on."
        investor_meaning: "Sub-100ms P50 on PostgreSQL + Neo4j hybrid. Production-ready, horizontally scalable. No caching tricks."
      - metric: "Processing Throughput"
        result: "83 min/episode"
        hollywood_meaning: "Upload scripts Friday evening. Complete knowledge graph by Monday morning. Overnight batch processing, not a weekend project."
        investor_meaning: "3.6x faster than baseline after async pipeline optimisation. Linear cost scaling per episode&mdash;no superlinear blowup at series length."
      - metric: "Entity Resolution Speed"
        result: "120ms P95"
        hollywood_meaning: "&ldquo;Is this the same character?&rdquo; resolved instantly&mdash;even across seasons, even after name changes, even when the script just says &lsquo;the bartender.&rsquo;"
        investor_meaning: "ChromaDB + Neo4j hybrid scales in constant time per entity pair. Contrastive entity sharpening eliminates the N&sup2; trap."

  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # 3. SCALE — THE HONEST VERSION
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # V1 → V2 CHANGES (significant):
  # V1 wove numbers into a prose paragraph. Good writing, but
  # rhythmically identical to everything else on the page.
  #
  # V2 opens with a staccato confession: "We don't extract
  # everything." This is the honesty moment that earns trust
  # for everything that follows. The concession (90.2%, not
  # 100%) is reframed as design intent, not limitation.
  #
  # 726 is correctly here as its primary home per v2 primer.
  # Other pages reference it only in compressed form.
  #
  # RHYTHMIC MODE: Staccato confession → sustained argument.
  # GEAR: Evidence.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  - id: scale
    type: prose
    background: page
    label: "Scale"
    headline: "We Didn&rsquo;t Benchmark on Toy Examples"
    body: >
      We don&rsquo;t extract everything.
      <br><br>
      Ninety percent. Validated against human annotation across the full dataset.
      <br><br>
      The other ten percent is genuinely ambiguous&mdash;characters the script
      doesn&rsquo;t name, relationships implied but never stated, moments where
      two professional annotators looked at the same scene and disagreed about
      what was happening. We flag those. You decide. That is not a limitation.
      That is the design.
      <br><br>
      What that ninety percent covers: 726 canonical entities across four seasons
      of <em>The West Wing</em>&mdash;from heads of state to walk-on characters
      who appear once and might return three seasons later. 80+ episodes across
      five series with different narrative structures, different temporal patterns,
      different ratios of dialogue to action. 15,000+ graph relationships with
      dense connectivity across causal, thematic, temporal, and emotional edges.
      <br><br>
      And zero entity drift. Process the same episode twice, get the same graph.
      Process it a third time six months later, get the same graph again. The same
      character mentioned in Episode 1 and Episode 40 resolves to the same canonical
      entity with the same UUID. Deterministic, reproducible, and verifiable&mdash;which
      is another way of saying: these aren&rsquo;t benchmarks we ran once and then
      stopped looking. They hold.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # 4. VALIDATION METHODOLOGY
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # Preserved from v1. The playful double-take headline
  # ("We Still Made Them Argue") already provides rhythmic
  # relief. The intellectual honesty of showing methodology
  # is the whole point of this section.
  #
  # GEAR: Precision.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  - id: methodology
    type: prose
    background: surface
    label: "Methodology"
    headline: "Two Annotators. 96.3% Agreement. And We Still Made Them Argue."
    body: >
      <strong>Human Annotation Baseline.</strong> Two independent annotators reviewed
      the same material without seeing each other&rsquo;s work or Fabula&rsquo;s output.
      They agreed 96.3% of the time. Where they disagreed, they adjudicated&mdash;discussed
      the edge case, examined the source text, reached consensus. Fabula&rsquo;s accuracy
      is measured against that consensus, not against either individual annotator and
      certainly not against itself. This is how you build a benchmark that survives
      peer review.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Cross-Episode Consistency.</strong> The hardest problem in narrative
      extraction isn&rsquo;t identifying a character in one scene. It&rsquo;s knowing
      that the &ldquo;Andy&rdquo; in Episode 1 and the &ldquo;Andrea Wyatt&rdquo; in
      Episode 40 are the same person. We measure entity UUID stability across the full
      series run: 98.7%. Manual adjudication is only triggered for genuine edge cases&mdash;name
      changes after marriage, promotions that change how characters are addressed, aliases
      that the writers invented to mislead the audience.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Reproducibility Is Not a Feature. It&rsquo;s an Obligation.</strong>
      Process the same input twice, get the same output. No stochastic drift, no
      accumulated error, no results that depend on which server handled the request.
      Deterministic extraction with schema-enforced output validation. If a benchmark
      can&rsquo;t be reproduced, it isn&rsquo;t a benchmark. It&rsquo;s a press release.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Open Dataset (Planned).</strong> We intend to open-source our <em>West Wing</em>
      annotations for academic validation&mdash;a reproducible benchmark for narrative
      extraction research. The field needs shared evaluation standards. Publishing ours
      is the smallest useful thing we can do about that.
