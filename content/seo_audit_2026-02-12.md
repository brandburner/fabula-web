# Fabula SEO Audit — 2026-02-12

**Focus area**: Context graphs (user-specified)

## Executive Summary

Fabula's marketing copy is well-written and strategically positioned, but it's leaving significant SEO value on the table by not adopting terminology the AI industry is now actively searching for. The biggest opportunity: **"context graph"** is the hottest term in enterprise AI (Foundation Capital's December 2025 essay called it "a trillion-dollar opportunity"), and Fabula is literally building one for entertainment — but the word "context graph" appears zero times across all six pages. Secondary gaps include "GraphRAG" (Fabula's Neo4j+ChromaDB hybrid *is* GraphRAG but never says so) and "context engineering" (strong section on the platform page, but absent from meta fields where search engines index it). Three meta descriptions exceed the 155-character limit, and one meta title is far too short. The brand voice is strong; most suggestions require adding a phrase, not rewriting.

## Trend Landscape

### Rising Terms

| Term | Search Context | Relevance to Fabula | Suggested Placement |
|------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Context graph** | Foundation Capital essay (Dec 2025) coined "context graph" as AI's trillion-dollar opportunity. Amnic, Diginomica, Neo4j, Atlan, Causaly all publishing on this in Jan–Feb 2026. | **Direct fit.** Fabula builds a context graph for narrative — entities, events, decisions, and traces stitched across time. The term describes exactly what Fabula does. | Homepage meta, platform meta, platform headline, about body, footer breadcrumb |
| **Context engineering** | Andrej Karpathy endorsed the shift from "prompt engineering" to "context engineering" (Jun 2025). Now foundational in AI developer discourse. Shopify CEO, Anthropic, and dozens of enterprise voices amplified. | **Already present** on platform page as a section. But absent from all meta fields. | Platform meta description, homepage body |
| **GraphRAG** | 2026 consensus: GraphRAG (graph-augmented retrieval) is the standard for trustworthy enterprise AI. Microsoft, Neo4j, LightRAG all publishing. | **Exact architectural match.** Fabula's Neo4j + ChromaDB hybrid *is* GraphRAG applied to narrative. The copy never uses the term. | Platform page (entity resolution section), benchmarks |
| **Decision traces / decision lineage** | Foundation Capital's core concept. Context graphs capture "not just what happened, but why it was allowed to happen." | **Strong fit.** Fabula's adjudication audit chain captures exactly this — reasoning, confidence scores, evidence weighed. The extraction chain headline already says "Decision Lineage Capture." | Platform sections (adjudication, extraction chain), about page |
| **Agentic knowledge graph** | Medium, enterprise blogs: dynamic, AI-constructed graphs that evolve with reasoning. | **Partial fit.** Fabula's graph is constructed by AI agents, but "agentic" implies autonomy that may overstate the human-in-loop design. Use selectively. | Platform page sidebar (with qualification) |
| **Knowledge-first architecture** | LinkedIn trend pieces: moving beyond "data-first" to "knowledge-first." | **Natural fit.** Fabula is literally knowledge-first — structured knowledge graph before any analytics. | About page, platform intro |
| **World model** | AI research: systems that maintain persistent state representations. | **Direct fit.** Fabula's dual temporal indices (fabula/syuzhet) function as a narrative world model. The platform page uses this phrase once — could use it more prominently. | Platform page (graph construction step), about page |
| **Hybrid retrieval** (graph + vector) | Consensus emerging: "vector vs. graph" is a false dichotomy; production systems need both. | **Exact match.** Neo4j for structural queries + ChromaDB for semantic similarity. | Platform (entity resolution), benchmarks |
| **Narrative intelligence** | Not yet crowded. Fabula's brand voice doc lists this as a preferred term. Minimal competition in search. | **Owned opportunity.** Fabula can own this term since no competitor has claimed it. | Homepage, about page, meta descriptions |
| **Entity resolution** | Core capability in enterprise AI, data engineering, and knowledge management. Rising search volume. | **Core capability.** Fabula's contrastive entity sharpening is a distinctive approach to entity resolution. | Platform meta, benchmarks, about page |
| **Structured context** | The counter-positioning to "dump everything in the context window." Fabula's approach is explicitly structured. | **Natural fit.** Already implicit in the copy but not called out as a term. | Platform (context engineering section) |
| **Governed context** | Audit trails, provenance, evidence requirements. Enterprise AI trust layer. | **Strong fit.** Fabula's confidence gating, evidence grounding, and audit chains are governed context for narrative. | Platform (guardrails section) |
| **Backbone** | Foundation Capital and Amnic both frame context graphs as "the backbone" of enterprise AI ("the invisible backbone that allows AI systems to reason, personalize, adapt"). Amnic's headline: "The $1 Trillion AI Backbone Enterprises Can't Ignore in 2026." | **Strong positioning fit.** Fabula is building backbone infrastructure for entertainment IP — not a feature, not an app, but the structural layer everything else depends on. "Backbone" carries the same architectural weight as "infrastructure" (already an allowed power word) and reinforces the horizontal-platform thesis. | Homepage "beyond entertainment" section (e.g., "the narrative backbone for structured content"), platform "who this is for" section (investor card), about "what comes next" section. Consider pairing: "context graph backbone" to capture both trending terms in one phrase. |

### Saturated Terms to Avoid

| Term | Why Saturated | Current Usage in Fabula | Recommended Action |
|------|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **AI-powered** | Every tool claims this. Zero differentiation. Returns millions of generic results. | Not used (good) | Continue avoiding |
| **Game-changing** | Already forbidden by brand voice. Overused across all sectors. | Not used (good) | Continue avoiding |
| **End-to-end** | Overused in enterprise AI marketing. Vague, means different things to different audiences. | Not used | Continue avoiding |
| **Cutting-edge / Next-gen** | Generic tech marketing filler. No search value, no credibility with technical audience. | Not used (good) | Continue avoiding |
| **AI assistant** | Saturated by ChatGPT, Copilot, and hundreds of general-purpose tools. Fabula is infrastructure, not an assistant. | Not used (good) | Continue avoiding. Brand voice correctly positions as "context engine" |
| **Unlock** | Already forbidden by brand voice. Generic value-proposition verb. | Not used (good) | Continue avoiding |
| **Story generator** | Dominated by consumer writing tools (Sudowrite, NovelAI, Toolbaz). Wrong category entirely. | Not used (good) | Never use. Fabula analyses stories, it doesn't generate them. |

### Opportunity Gaps

| Search Intent | Current Gap | Suggested Content |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **"context graph entertainment"** | Zero results for this exact phrase. Nobody has claimed this intersection. | Add "context graph" to homepage and platform copy. Position Fabula as "the context graph for entertainment IP." |
| **"GraphRAG narrative" / "GraphRAG media"** | No competitor uses GraphRAG terminology for entertainment/media. | Platform page: explicitly name the Neo4j+ChromaDB architecture as a GraphRAG implementation. |
| **"AI story bible software"** | Competitors (Sudowrite, NovelAI) own "AI story writing" but nobody owns "AI story bible." Fabula's "story bible that updates itself" is close but not in meta fields. | Ensure "story bible" appears in homepage and for-production meta descriptions. |
| **"continuity tracking software"** / **"script continuity AI"** | No competitor targets this exact search intent. Script supervisors searching for tools land on generic results. | For-production page: add "continuity tracking" to meta description. |
| **"narrative knowledge graph"** | Academic papers use this term but no commercial product targets it. | About page and platform page: use this phrase in body copy and at least one heading. |
| **"AI script analysis for production"** | Competitors (Largo AI, ScriptBook, Callaia) target "script analysis" but focus on box-office prediction, not continuity/story-bible. Fabula's positioning is different and defensible. | For-production page: consider adding a comparison note in a future section. |

## Per-Page Findings

### Homepage (`content/homepage.yaml`)

**Meta**
- **Current title** (52 chars): `Fabula &mdash; The Context Engine for Narrative Production`
- **Current description** (156 chars): `Fabula is a context engine for narrative production&mdash;the first story bible that updates itself as you write. For production teams and technology investors.`
- **Issue**: Description is 1 character over the 155-char limit (rendered). Minor but worth trimming.
- **Suggested title**: No change needed. Strong, under limit, includes primary positioning term.
- **Suggested description** (`meta.description`):
  > `Fabula is a context engine for narrative production&mdash;the first story bible that updates itself. For showrunners, writers&rsquo; rooms, and AI investors.`
  - *Rationale*: Drops "as you write" (implied) and "technology" (generic). Adds "showrunners" and "writers' rooms" for Hollywood search intent. 152 chars rendered. **Audience: Both.**

**Headlines**
- `hero.headline`: "Never Lose Track of Your Story Again" — Conversational, good for Hollywood, but zero SEO-relevant terms. The real SEO work is done by the body copy.
- **Suggestion**: No change. The headline serves its conversational purpose. The meta fields carry the SEO weight.

**Body Copy**
- `sections[2].headline` ("Infrastructure for Structured Content"): Consider adding "context graph" here.
  - **Before**: `Infrastructure for Structured Content`
  - **After**: `Context Graph Infrastructure for Structured Content`
  - *Rationale*: "Context graph" is the single highest-value term Fabula is missing. This section is about the horizontal infrastructure play — perfect placement. **Audience: Investor.**
- `footer_breadcrumb`: Currently "Fabula is a context engine. We started with entertainment."
  - **Suggestion**: No change. This is a brand line, not an SEO target. Consistent across all pages.

**Findings count**: 3

---

### For Production (`content/for_production.yaml`)

**Meta**
- **Current title** (58 chars): `Fabula for Production &mdash; The Story Bible That Updates Itself`
- **Current description** (153 chars): `Stop maintaining spreadsheet story bibles. Fabula automatically tracks characters, continuity, and assets across every episode you&rsquo;ve ever written.`
- **Assessment**: Both are strong. Length is good. "Story bible" in title is high-value. "Continuity" in description is good.
- **Suggested description** (`meta.description`):
  > `Stop maintaining spreadsheet story bibles. Fabula tracks characters, continuity, and assets across every episode&mdash;AI-powered continuity tracking for series television.`
  - *Rationale*: Adds "continuity tracking" and "series television" — specific search intents that no competitor targets. 171 chars — needs trimming. Alternative:
  > `Ditch spreadsheet story bibles. Fabula tracks characters, continuity, and assets across every episode&mdash;built for series television production teams.`
  - 153 chars rendered. **Audience: Hollywood.**

**Headlines**
- `hero.headline` ("Wait, Did We Already Do That?"): Zero SEO value but perfect emotional hook. No change.
- `sections[1].headline` ("Four Steps. No Spreadsheets."): Good positioning. No change.
- `sections[2].headline` ("Not a Prototype. A Production System."): Good. No change.

**Body Copy**
- `sections[0].scenarios[2].solution`: Mentions "every relationship, every established fact, every piece of continuity." Consider adding "continuity tracking" as an explicit phrase:
  - **Before**: `Fabula tracks every relationship, every established fact, every piece of continuity across your entire series.`
  - **After**: `Fabula&rsquo;s continuity tracking covers every relationship, every established fact, every piece of canon across your entire series.`
  - *Rationale*: "Continuity tracking" becomes an indexable phrase. "Canon" is writers' room language that reinforces authenticity. **Audience: Hollywood.**

**Findings count**: 2

---

### Platform (`content/platform.yaml`)

**Meta**
- **Current title** (50 chars): `Platform &mdash; Context Engine for Narrative Production`
- **Current description** (174 chars): `Fabula is a context engine that decomposes narrative into typed knowledge graphs with entity extraction, dual temporal indices, and hallucination-guarded extraction from unstructured sources at scale.`
- **Issues**: (1) Title is missing "Fabula" brand name. (2) Description is **19 characters over the 155-char limit**.
- **Suggested title** (`meta.title`):
  > `Fabula Platform &mdash; Context Graph Architecture for Narrative`
  - *Rationale*: Adds brand name. Replaces "Context Engine" with "Context Graph Architecture" — the highest-value SEO term for this page's investor/technical audience. 58 chars. **Audience: Investor.**
- **Suggested description** (`meta.description`):
  > `How Fabula decomposes narrative into a context graph&mdash;typed entity extraction, dual temporal indices, GraphRAG architecture, and hallucination-guarded extraction at scale.`
  - *Rationale*: Adds "context graph" and "GraphRAG" — two of the hottest search terms in 2026 AI. Removes "from unstructured sources" (implied by "extraction"). ~170 chars — still over. Tighter version:
  > `Fabula&rsquo;s context graph architecture: typed entity extraction, dual temporal indices, and GraphRAG-powered narrative intelligence at production scale.`
  - 155 chars rendered. **Audience: Investor/Technical.**

**Headlines**
- `hero.headline` ("Stories Are Knowledge Graphs. We Treat Them That Way."): Strong. But "knowledge graph" is the older term. Consider:
  - **Before**: `Stories Are Knowledge Graphs. We Treat Them That Way.`
  - **After**: `Stories Are Context Graphs. We Treat Them That Way.`
  - *Rationale*: "Context graph" is the 2026 term. Foundation Capital's essay distinguished context graphs from knowledge graphs: "Knowledge graphs answer 'what is true?' Context graphs answer 'what matters right now, and why?'" Fabula's graph captures decision traces, temporal state, and provenance — it IS a context graph, not just a knowledge graph. **Audience: Investor.** *Brand voice check*: Consistent with positioning table ("context engine" over "knowledge graph tool").
  - **Tension**: The about page uses "knowledge graph" extensively in an educational context (explaining why graphs beat spreadsheets). That usage is fine — "knowledge graph" as a generic concept vs. "context graph" as Fabula's specific value proposition.

- `sections[1].headline` ("A Compositional Cognitive Architecture for Decision Lineage Capture."): Excellent for "decision lineage" SEO. No change.

- `sections[2].headline` ("Every Function Gets Exactly the Context It Needs. Nothing More."): Great copy, but missing the term "context engineering" in the headline itself.
  - **Before**: `Every Function Gets Exactly the Context It Needs. Nothing More.`
  - **After**: `Context Engineering: Every Function Gets Exactly What It Needs.`
  - *Rationale*: "Context engineering" in the H2 makes it indexable. The body already references Karpathy. **Audience: Technical.** *Risk*: Slightly less literary than the original. Alternative: keep headline, add "context engineering" to `sections[2].label` (currently "Context Engineering" — already there! Good). The label is not H2 but it signals topicality.
  - **Recommendation**: Keep headline as-is since the `label` field already says "Context Engineering" and that's sufficient for topical signaling. The literary headline is more valuable than the SEO gain from restructuring it.

- `sections[5].headline` ("Zero Entity Drift. From Pilot to Series Finale."): Strong. "Entity drift" is a distinctive term. No change.

**Body Copy**
- `sections[3].intro`: "We treat hallucination the way databases treat corruption" — excellent framing. No change.
- `sections[5].intro`: "We solve this with a hybrid architecture: Neo4j for structural queries and relationship traversal, ChromaDB for semantic similarity and fuzzy matching."
  - **Suggestion**: Add "GraphRAG" reference:
  - **Before**: `We solve this with a hybrid architecture: Neo4j for structural queries and relationship traversal, ChromaDB for semantic similarity and fuzzy matching.`
  - **After**: `We solve this with a hybrid GraphRAG architecture: Neo4j for structural queries and relationship traversal, ChromaDB for semantic similarity and fuzzy matching.`
  - *Rationale*: A single word insertion ("GraphRAG") maps this description to the 2026 consensus term. **Audience: Technical/Investor.** *Brand voice check*: Technical precision, not marketing jargon. Passes.

- `sections[9].cards[3].description` (Investors card): "We're building the knowledge graph infrastructure layer for entertainment IP."
  - **Suggestion**:
  - **Before**: `We&rsquo;re building the knowledge graph infrastructure layer for entertainment IP.`
  - **After**: `We&rsquo;re building the context graph infrastructure layer for entertainment IP.`
  - *Rationale*: Aligns with the positioning table ("context engine" not "knowledge graph tool"). **Audience: Investor.**

**Findings count**: 6

### Benchmarks (`content/benchmarks.yaml`)

**Meta**
- **Current title** (44 chars): `Benchmarks &mdash; The Proof Is in the Processing`
- **Current description** (161 chars): `Real metrics from processing 80+ episodes of television. Accuracy, performance, and scale benchmarks with dual-audience framing for production teams and investors.`
- **Issues**: (1) Title missing "Fabula" brand name. (2) Description is 6 chars over limit. (3) "Dual-audience framing" is internal strategy language, not user-facing search intent.
- **Suggested title** (`meta.title`):
  > `Fabula Benchmarks &mdash; Narrative Extraction Accuracy at Scale`
  - *Rationale*: Adds brand name. "Narrative extraction" and "accuracy" are high-value technical search terms. 58 chars. **Audience: Both.**
- **Suggested description** (`meta.description`):
  > `Real metrics from processing 80+ episodes of television. Entity extraction accuracy, relationship precision, and query latency&mdash;validated against human annotation.`
  - *Rationale*: Replaces internal language with specific, indexable metric categories. Adds "human annotation" — a trust signal. 155 chars. **Audience: Both.**

**Headlines**
- `hero.headline` ("The Proof Is in the Processing"): Decent. No change.
- `sections[0].headline` ("Does It Actually Work?"): Conversational, engaging. No change.
- `sections[2].headline` ("Production-Scale Validation"): Good. No change.
- `sections[3].headline` ("How We Validate"): Good. No change.

**Body Copy**
- No significant gaps. The dual-audience framing (`hollywood_meaning` / `investor_meaning`) is the page's unique strength and doesn't need SEO changes — it's structural, not prose.

**Findings count**: 2

---

### About (`content/about.yaml`)

**Meta**
- **Current title** (47 chars): `About Fabula &mdash; Why Stories Deserve Better Tools`
- **Current description** (149 chars): `The narratological foundations behind Fabula&mdash;why stories are webs, why graphs matter, and why we built a context engine for narrative production.`
- **Assessment**: Both are good. Length is within limits. "Context engine" is present.
- **Suggested description** (`meta.description`):
  > `The narratological foundations behind Fabula&mdash;why stories are webs, why narrative knowledge graphs matter, and why we built a context engine for production.`
  - *Rationale*: Inserts "narrative knowledge graphs" — a term with academic and technical search value that no commercial competitor targets. 159 chars — 4 over. Tighter:
  > `Why stories are webs, not lines. The narratological foundations behind Fabula&mdash;a narrative knowledge graph and context engine for production.`
  - 144 chars. **Audience: Both.**

**Headlines**
- `hero.headline` ("Stories Are Not Lines. They Are Webs."): Beautiful. Brand-defining. No change.
- `sections[0].headline` ("Fabula and Syuzhet: The Oldest Problem in Narrative Theory"): Excellent for long-tail academic/technical searches. No change.
- `sections[2].headline` ("Why a Knowledge Graph, Not a Better Spreadsheet"): Consider updating to "context graph":
  - **Before**: `Why a Knowledge Graph, Not a Better Spreadsheet`
  - **After**: `Why a Context Graph, Not a Better Spreadsheet`
  - *Rationale*: Aligns with 2026 terminology and Fabula's own positioning. The body text can still explain knowledge graphs as a concept. **Audience: Both.** *Tension*: "Knowledge graph" is the more widely understood generic term for this educational context. The section is explaining *why graphs beat documents*, not distinguishing context graphs from knowledge graphs. **Recommendation**: Keep "Knowledge Graph" in this headline since it's serving an educational function. Add "context graph" in the body instead — e.g., in the paragraph about Neo4j+ChromaDB, note that this combination creates "what the industry now calls a context graph."

**Body Copy**
- `sections[2].body`: After the paragraph about Neo4j + ChromaDB, add a single sentence:
  - **Suggested insertion** (after "semantic intelligence" sentence): `The combination is what the AI industry now calls a context graph&mdash;a knowledge structure that captures not just what exists, but why decisions were made and how entities relate across time.`
  - *Rationale*: Defines "context graph" in Fabula's terms. Maps the established copy to the trending term. **Audience: Investor/Technical.**

- `sections[4].headline` ("The Work So Far"): Good. No change.
- `sections[5].headline` ("What Comes Next"): Good. No change.
- `sections[5].body`: Currently says "narrative knowledge graph." Good — already using this phrase.

**Findings count**: 2

### Early Access (`content/early_access.yaml`)

**Meta**
- **Current title** (26 chars): `Join Early Access &mdash; Fabula`
- **Current description** (117 chars): `Register your interest in Fabula. We&rsquo;re in private beta&mdash;tell us about your project and we&rsquo;ll reach out when we have capacity.`
- **Issues**: (1) Title is **far too short** at 26 chars — wasting 34 characters of indexable title space. (2) Description has room for more keywords.
- **Suggested title** (`meta.title`):
  > `Early Access &mdash; Fabula Context Engine for Narrative Production`
  - *Rationale*: Uses freed-up title space for primary positioning terms. 60 chars. **Audience: Both.**
  - Alternative (Hollywood-first):
  > `Early Access &mdash; Fabula Story Bible for Production Teams`
  - 55 chars. **Audience: Hollywood.**
- **Suggested description** (`meta.description`):
  > `Register your interest in Fabula&mdash;the context engine for narrative production. Private beta for series television, film development, and research partners.`
  - *Rationale*: Adds "series television" and "film development" — specific search intents. 155 chars. **Audience: Both.**

**Headlines**
- `hero.headline` ("See What Fabula Can Do With Your Scripts"): Decent. Could be stronger but serviceable. No change.

**Body Copy**
- `hero.body`: Good. No changes needed.
- `sections[0].intro`: Good. No changes needed.
- Form fields: Not indexable by search engines. No SEO relevance.

**Findings count**: 2

## Priority Actions

Ranked by estimated SEO impact:

1. **Add "context graph" to platform page meta and hero headline.** The platform page is the technical entry point for investor/VC search traffic. "Context graph" is the single most searched-for concept in enterprise AI in early 2026 (Foundation Capital essay, Neo4j blog, Amnic, Atlan, Causaly all publishing). Fabula is *literally building one* and the term appears zero times. Change hero from "knowledge graphs" to "context graphs" and update meta description. *Impact: High. Effort: 2 lines of YAML.*

2. **Fix platform page meta description length.** Currently 174 chars — 19 over the Google-displayed limit. Content after ~155 chars is truncated in search results. The most important keywords (entity extraction, temporal indices) are in the truncated portion. Rewrite to fit. *Impact: High. Effort: 1 line of YAML.*

3. **Add "Fabula" brand name to benchmarks and platform meta titles.** Both pages omit "Fabula" from their `<title>` tags. Brand name in title improves click-through rate from search results by ~15-30% (users recognise the brand). *Impact: Medium-high. Effort: 2 lines of YAML.*

4. **Expand early access meta title from 26 to ~55-60 chars.** Currently wasting over half the available title space. This is the conversion page — it should include positioning terms that reinforce what Fabula does for anyone who lands on it from search. *Impact: Medium. Effort: 1 line of YAML.*

5. **Insert "GraphRAG" into platform entity resolution section.** A single word addition ("hybrid GraphRAG architecture") maps Fabula's Neo4j+ChromaDB stack to the 2026 consensus term. Technical evaluators and investors searching for "GraphRAG" implementations will find this page. *Impact: Medium. Effort: 1 word.*

6. **Add "context graph" to homepage "beyond entertainment" section headline.** The homepage's infrastructure section is the bridge between entertainment and horizontal platform positioning. "Context Graph Infrastructure" signals to investors that Fabula operates in the trillion-dollar context-graph category. *Impact: Medium. Effort: 2 words.*

7. **Fix benchmarks meta description length and content.** Currently 161 chars with internal-facing language ("dual-audience framing"). Replace with specific, indexable metric terms. *Impact: Medium. Effort: 1 line of YAML.*

8. **Add "narrative knowledge graph" / "context graph" sentence to about page.** The about page ranks for educational/long-tail queries. A single sentence mapping Fabula's architecture to the "context graph" trend term connects the philosophical content to current search intent. *Impact: Low-medium. Effort: 1 sentence.*

## Brand Voice Compliance Notes

### Tensions Identified

1. **"Context graph" vs. "context engine"**: The brand voice doc positions Fabula as a "context engine" and avoids "knowledge graph tool." The term "context graph" is not in the avoid list and is *complementary* to "context engine": the engine builds and queries the graph. Recommendation: use "context graph" to describe *what Fabula produces* and "context engine" to describe *what Fabula is*. No conflict.

2. **"GraphRAG"**: This is a technical architecture term, not marketing jargon. It's precise, descriptive, and used by the engineering community (Neo4j, Microsoft, LightRAG). The brand voice favours technical precision. It belongs on the platform page and benchmarks, not on the for-production or homepage hero. **Passes voice check for technical pages.**

3. **"Narrative intelligence"**: Already listed in the positioning table as a preferred term (use instead of "AI story analysis"). Currently underused — appears zero times in YAML content. Should appear on the homepage and about page. **No tension.**

4. **"Agentic knowledge graph"**: The term "agentic" implies full autonomy and is trending toward hype-cycle saturation. Fabula's human-in-loop design is a deliberate counter-positioning. **Recommendation: avoid "agentic" as a modifier for Fabula.** Let competitors chase that term.

5. **"Entity resolution"**: Technical term, well-understood by both enterprise AI and data engineering audiences. Already used as a section heading on the platform page. Appropriate for meta fields on technical pages. **No tension.**

6. **"Decision lineage" / "decision traces"**: Foundation Capital's terminology. The extraction chain headline already uses "Decision Lineage Capture." Appropriate for investor-facing copy. **No tension** — it's precise, not breathless.

### Terms That Pass Brand Voice

All suggestions in this audit use terms from the "allowed" column or terms not in the "avoid" column:
- "Context graph" — infrastructure terminology, not jargon
- "GraphRAG" — architectural description, not marketing
- "Narrative intelligence" — explicitly listed as preferred
- "Entity resolution" — precise engineering term
- "Continuity tracking" — writers' room language
- "World model" — precise cognitive/AI term
- "Hybrid retrieval" — architectural description

### Terms Explicitly Avoided in This Audit

Per the positioning table and brand voice rules, this audit does not suggest:
- "Leverage", "synergy", "unlock", "game-changing", "revolutionary"
- "AI-powered", "next-gen", "cutting-edge"
- "Knowledge graph tool" (use "context engine" or "context graph")
- "AI story analysis" (use "narrative intelligence")
- "Automated wiki" (use "story bible that updates itself")
- "Enterprise-ready" (use "production-grade")

## Competitor Landscape Notes

### Direct Competitors (entertainment AI)

| Competitor | SEO Position | Fabula Differentiation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Largo AI** | "AI film analysis", box-office prediction, packaging decisions. SEO targets financial outcomes, not creative workflows. | Fabula targets production *process* (continuity, story bible, character tracking), not financial prediction. Different search intent entirely. |
| **ScriptBook** | "Script analysis and content validation." Predictive analytics focus. | Similar financial-outcome focus. Fabula's graph-based approach is architecturally different. |
| **StoryFit** | "Script analysis and audience prediction." Thin web presence. | Appears to be winding down or pivoting. Minimal SEO competition. |
| **Callaia** | "AI script coverage." Fast turnaround on script analysis. Sony, WB clients. | Callaia does coverage (read-and-evaluate); Fabula does extraction (read-and-structure). Complementary, not competitive, in search terms. |
| **Subtxt (Dramatica)** | "AI narrative theory." Small but devoted community. Dramatica theory integration. | Subtxt helps writers *construct* stories using theory. Fabula helps productions *manage* stories already written. Different intent. |
| **Netflix EKG** | Not marketed externally. Blog posts describe internal architecture. | Fabula explicitly positions against EKG's walled-garden model. "Open formats" section already does this well. |

### Adjacent Competitors (AI writing tools)

Sudowrite, NovelAI, Novel Crafter, and similar tools target *writers creating fiction*. They own "AI writing" and "story generator" search terms. Fabula should **never compete for these terms** — its audience is production teams managing existing IP, not individual writers generating new prose.

### Untargeted Search Intents (opportunity)

No competitor currently targets:
- "context graph for entertainment"
- "narrative knowledge graph software"
- "AI continuity tracking"
- "automated story bible"
- "GraphRAG for media"

These are open territory. Fabula's content can claim them with minor copy adjustments.
