# About Page — v2 Voice Primer Rewrite
# =====================================
#
# V2 PRIMER ASSIGNMENTS:
# Unique thesis: The gap between fabula and syuzhet is the oldest
#   unsolved problem in narrative theory — and it's an engineering
#   problem. Nobody built the infrastructure to solve it. We did.
# Signature show: Doctor Who
# Signature demonstration: Regeneration as identity continuity —
#   a protagonist who changes everything while remaining the same entity.
# Emotional movement: Intellectual seduction → diagnosis → wonder → conviction
#
# COMPETITIVE FOIL (this page's instance):
# Netflix EKG / studio metadata teams — expensive infrastructure
# built by engineers without narrative theory. The deeper foil:
# the entire category of "document-shaped tools applied to
# graph-shaped problems." Not the spreadsheet (homepage owns that)
# but the expensive, well-funded version of the same mistake.
#
# RHYTHMIC MODES USED:
# Hero: Sustained argument
# Narratological foundation: Sustained argument (intellectual core)
# Infrastructure gap: Opens with scenic, resolves to sustained argument
# Doctor Who evidence: Sustained argument + wonder (Gear 2)
# Five Series: Staccato — compressed, one sentence per show
# Principles: Magnanimous declaration
# CTA: Magnanimous declaration
#
# V1 → V2 CHANGES:
# - "What's Next" section removed. "Adaptation becomes a query"
#   is investor-speak. The capabilities it describes belong on
#   Platform page. About page's job is: the theory, the gap,
#   the demonstration, the convictions. Not the roadmap.
# - "Five Series" restructured. V1 gave full paragraphs to each
#   show, violating primary home rule (Worf belongs on For
#   Production, Indiana Jones belongs on Platform). V2 compresses
#   to one sentence per show — enough to imply breadth without
#   stealing other pages' evidence.
# - Principles section shifted to magnanimous declaration mode.
#   V1 was sustained argument throughout. The principles are
#   convictions, not arguments — they should sound declarative
#   and unhurried.
# - Infrastructure gap tightened and given scenic opening.
# - Footer mantra varied per v2 Section 12.

    That&rsquo;s not an accusation. It&rsquo;s a century-old insight. In 1925, the Russian
    formalists gave it a name: the gap between <em>fabula</em>&mdash;what happened in the story
    world&mdash;and <em>syuzhet</em>&mdash;the order in which the audience encounters it. Every
    flashback exploits that gap. Every cold open depends on it. Every non-linear narrative is an
    argument about which gap matters most. And for a hundred years, nobody built the infrastructure
    to represent both sides computationally. We did.

    body: >
      <em>Fabula</em> is what happened&mdash;the chronological sequence of events in the story
      world. <em>Syuzhet</em> is how it&rsquo;s told&mdash;the order in which the audience
      encounters those events. The distinction is not academic. It is computational. To model a
      story properly, you need dual parallel indices with typed edges connecting them. When a writer
      introduces a flashback in Episode 15 that recontextualises a scene from Episode 3, the
      knowledge graph needs to represent both the story-world sequence <em>and</em> the narrative
      presentation order&mdash;and the causal, thematic, and emotional relationships between them.
      <br><br>
      This matters for production because the questions showrunners actually ask are questions about
      this gap. &ldquo;What did the audience know at this point in the story?&rdquo; is a syuzhet
      query. &ldquo;What had actually happened by this point in the timeline?&rdquo; is a fabula
      query. They sound similar. They are fundamentally different operations, and answering them
      correctly requires maintaining both indices simultaneously. Flashback impact analysis. Causal
      chain traversal. Audience knowledge state at any point in the narrative. These are graph
      operations. They require graph infrastructure. Most tools don&rsquo;t even try.

      We didn&rsquo;t invent this framework. G&eacute;rard Genette described it in 1972.

      Imagine a narratologist and a database engineer at the same whiteboard. The
      narratologist draws a diagram of <em>fabula</em> and <em>syuzhet</em>&mdash;dual
      temporal layers with typed connections between them. The database engineer says:
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a graph.&rdquo; And it is. The shape of the problem and the
      shape of the solution have been obvious to both disciplines for decades. They just
      never stood at the same whiteboard.
      <br><br>
      The studios tried from their side. Netflix built its Entertainment Knowledge
      Graph. Disney assembled content metadata teams. But these systems were designed by
      engineers solving engineering problems&mdash;content classification, recommendation,
      search&mdash;without the narrative theory that would have told them what to model.
      They can tell you which actor appears in which episode. They cannot tell you why a
      character&rsquo;s decision in Season 2 makes a storyline in Season 4 impossible.
      That is not a feature they lack. It is a category of question their architecture
      cannot represent&mdash;because narrative events with typed causal relationships,
      characters with temporal state, and the structural gap between telling and
      happening were never part of the data model.
      <br><br>
      We put both disciplines in the same room. Fabula exists because that conversation
      finally happened: what if you modelled <em>fabula</em> and <em>syuzhet</em> as
      dual temporal indices in a graph database, with every connection between
      events&mdash;causal, thematic, emotional&mdash;preserved as typed, queryable
      edges? The answer is infrastructure the industry has needed for decades.

    body: >
      Consider the Doctor. Not a specific Doctor&mdash;the Doctor. A character who has changed
      face, personality, voice, and actor fifteen times while remaining canonically the same
      entity. The Tenth Doctor and the Eleventh Doctor are not different characters. They are
      the same Character node with different participation states. When the Eleventh Doctor
      references the Time War&mdash;an event the Tenth Doctor experienced, which the War Doctor
      fought in, which the First Doctor fled from&mdash;the graph must track continuity across
      incarnation. It must know that the grief the Eleventh Doctor carries in a quiet scene on
      Trenzalore is causally connected to a decision the Tenth Doctor made on the Crucible, which
      is itself a consequence of something the Time Lords did before the character had this face.
      That is not a metadata problem. It is a graph traversal across identity states.
      <br><br>
      It gets harder. &ldquo;John Smith&rdquo; is an alias the Doctor uses across multiple
      incarnations. John Smith in 1913 is the Tenth Doctor in a human disguise. John Smith in
      2007 is also the Tenth Doctor, in a different context. But in the expanded canon, other
      incarnations have used the same alias. The entity resolution system must understand that
      John Smith is always the Doctor, even when the faces are different and the contexts are
      decades apart. This is the kind of problem that breaks document-shaped tools completely.
      A wiki page for &ldquo;The Doctor&rdquo; either picks one incarnation as primary or
      becomes an unnavigable wall of text. A graph preserves every incarnation as a distinct
      participation state while maintaining canonical identity across all of them.
      <br><br>
      The deepest architectural decision is the one that makes this possible: the separation of
      <em>identity</em> from <em>state</em>. A Character node represents who someone
      is&mdash;their canonical identity, their aliases, their persistent attributes. An
      EventParticipation represents who they are <em>in a specific moment</em>&mdash;their
      emotional state, their goals, what they did. The Doctor is one node. The Doctor has
      hundreds of participations, spread across incarnations, centuries of in-world time, and
      fifty years of broadcast history. Each participation preserves the specific state of the
      character at that moment without overwriting any other. Documents flatten. Graphs preserve.

  # (it's on its home page here). The others get one each.

    headline: "Five Series. Five Things That Broke."
    body: >
      Every series we processed taught us something the previous one couldn&rsquo;t.
      That&rsquo;s why we chose them.
      <br><br>
      <em>Doctor Who</em> broke identity continuity. A protagonist who changes face,
      personality, and actor while remaining canonically the same entity forced the
      architecture to separate who a character <em>is</em> from who they are <em>right
      now</em>.
      <br><br>
      <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> broke alias resolution. One character,
      seven seasons, five canonical names. The system had to learn that rank changes
      and cultural naming conventions don&rsquo;t create new people.
      <br><br>
      <em>The West Wing</em> broke relationship density. Political narrative generates
      a web of shifting alliances so interconnected that the graph had to handle density
      without losing legibility.
      <br><br>
      <em>Motherland: Fort Salem</em> broke realist ontology. Military witchcraft and
      alternate history meant the system had to model rules that contradict the real world
      without treating them as errors.
      <br><br>
      <em>Indiana Jones</em> broke cinematic time. Decades of in-world history compressed
      into two hours, with temporal jumps the graph must represent as structure, not as gaps.
      <br><br>
      We did not choose easy material and claim generality. We chose the material that
      would break a brittle system, and built one that didn&rsquo;t break.
