# About Page — Brand Voice Transformation
# ========================================
#
# STRATEGIC ARGUMENT (sustained throughout):
# The gap between the told order and the happened order is the oldest
# unsolved problem in narrative theory. It is also an engineering
# problem. Nobody built the infrastructure to solve it computationally
# until now. That failure has cost studios millions and showrunners
# their sanity. We built the thing that was never built.
#
# COMPETITIVE FOIL:
# The spreadsheet, the wiki, the PDF story bible — but also the
# deeper foil: the entire category of "document-shaped tools" applied
# to graph-shaped problems. The About page diagnoses WHY documents
# fail at a theoretical level, not just a practical one.
#
# AUDIENCE:
# Intellectually serious readers — showrunners, narratologists,
# investors who want to understand the depth. This is the page that
# gets forwarded to colleagues with "you need to read this."
#
# VOICE REGISTER:
# The Intelligent Friend at their most essayistic. Confident,
# conspiratorial, precise. Diagnoses, never empathises. Makes
# an argument, not a pitch.
#
# PAGE ROLE:
# Intellectual anchor of the site. If the homepage is the opening
# argument, this is the peer-reviewed paper behind it. Narratological
# depth, architectural conviction, philosophical seriousness.

# The word "story" does double duty: the audience makes stories,

    That&rsquo;s not an accusation. It&rsquo;s a century-old insight. In 1925, the Russian
    formalists gave it a name: the gap between <em>fabula</em>&mdash;what happened in the story
    world&mdash;and <em>syuzhet</em>&mdash;the order in which the audience encounters it. Every
    flashback exploits that gap. Every cold open depends on it. Every non-linear narrative is an
    argument about which gap matters most. And for a hundred years, nobody built the infrastructure
    to represent both sides computationally. We did.

    headline: "Fabula and Syuzhet: The Oldest Problem in Narrative Theory"
    body: >
      <em>Fabula</em> is what happened&mdash;the chronological sequence of events in the story
      world. <em>Syuzhet</em> is how it&rsquo;s told&mdash;the order in which the audience
      encounters those events. The distinction is not academic. It is computational. To model a
      story properly, you need dual parallel indices with typed edges connecting them. When a writer
      introduces a flashback in Episode 15 that recontextualises a scene from Episode 3, the
      knowledge graph needs to represent both the story-world sequence <em>and</em> the narrative
      presentation order&mdash;and the causal, thematic, and emotional relationships between them.
      <br><br>
      This matters for production because the questions showrunners actually ask are questions about
      this gap. &ldquo;What did the audience know at this point in the story?&rdquo; is a syuzhet
      query. &ldquo;What had actually happened by this point in the timeline?&rdquo; is a fabula
      query. They sound similar. They are fundamentally different operations, and answering them
      correctly requires maintaining both indices simultaneously. Flashback impact analysis. Causal
      chain traversal. Audience knowledge state at any point in the narrative. These are graph
      operations. They require graph infrastructure. Most tools don&rsquo;t even try.

      We didn&rsquo;t invent this framework. G&eacute;rard Genette described it in 1972.

  # 2. THE INFRASTRUCTURE WAS NEVER BUILT
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # VOICE STRATEGY: Diagnostic, not empathetic. The original
  # section opened with "We've been in writers' rooms. We've seen
  # the chaos..." — empathy-first, origin-story framing. The voice
  # primer says: "Fabula doesn't empathise. It diagnoses."
  #
  # REVERSAL: "The Infrastructure Was Never Built" — surface reads
  # as a complaint or an excuse. Resolved reading: this is an
  # architectural diagnosis. The tools exist (spreadsheets, wikis,
  # proprietary metadata systems). The infrastructure — the layer
  # that treats narrative structure as queryable, typed, temporal
  # data — was never built. Nobody built it. Not Netflix, not
  # Disney, not the studios spending millions on content metadata
  # teams. They built documents about stories. They never built
  # the computational layer that understands story structure.
  #
  # FOIL: Studio proprietary systems — specific (Netflix's
  # Entertainment Knowledge Graph, Disney's content metadata
  # teams), not generic. Diagnosed as expensive, manual, siloed.

    headline: "The Infrastructure Was Never Built"
    body: >
      Every major studio has spent millions on proprietary content metadata systems. Netflix has
      its Entertainment Knowledge Graph. Disney has content metadata teams. These systems are
      manually curated, siloed per show, and not embedded in creative workflows. They can tell
      you which actor appears in which episode. They cannot tell you why a character&rsquo;s
      decision in Season 2 makes a storyline in Season 4 impossible. That is not a feature they
      lack. It is a category of question they were never designed to answer.
      <br><br>
      The gap is architectural, not budgetary. A spreadsheet with tabs for each season is not an
      infrastructure failure because it&rsquo;s underfunded. It&rsquo;s an infrastructure failure
      because spreadsheets model lists, and stories are not lists. A wiki that was accurate in
      February is not a knowledge management problem. It&rsquo;s a temporal data problem&mdash;the
      wiki has no concept of &ldquo;accurate as of which episode.&rdquo; A PDF story bible that
      the script coordinator updates on Fridays is not a process problem. It&rsquo;s a single
      point of failure with no version control, no query interface, and no mechanism to detect
      its own inaccuracy.
      <br><br>
      Nobody ever built the infrastructure layer that treats narrative structure the way databases
      treat transactions&mdash;with typed relationships, temporal indices, and zero drift. Not
      because it was impossible. Because it required thinking about stories as data structures
      rather than documents, and the people who think about stories and the people who think about
      data structures have historically not been in the same room. We put them in the same room.

  # 3. SPREADSHEETS LIST. WIKIS DESCRIBE. ONLY GRAPHS ANSWER.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # VOICE STRATEGY: The competitive foil at its sharpest. Three
  # words diagnose each tool category. Then we demonstrate: show
  # a graph query running in prose (not code) that no spreadsheet
  # or wiki could answer. The reader should feel the architectural
  # argument click into place.
  #
  # STRUCTURAL NOTE: The deepest move in this section is the
  # identity/state separation — Character vs. EventParticipation.
  # This is the architectural insight that distinguishes a knowledge
  # graph from a document. Documents flatten. Graphs preserve.

    body: >
      The question &ldquo;which characters have scenes with both the President and the First Lady,
      and how did those relationships change after the MS scandal?&rdquo; is not a hard question.
      Any writer on <em>The West Wing</em> could answer it from memory&mdash;for a while. By
      Season 4, they couldn&rsquo;t. By the time a new writer joins mid-season, they have no
      chance. The question requires traversal: following typed edges across temporal boundaries,
      filtering by relationship state, aggregating across episodes. Try that in a spreadsheet.
      Try it in a wiki. You will get silence, or you will get the script coordinator&rsquo;s
      best guess, which is the same thing.
      <br><br>
      A knowledge graph answers it in 87 milliseconds. Not because graphs are faster than
      spreadsheets&mdash;they are, but that&rsquo;s not the point. Because the question is
      a graph operation. It has a shape: start at two nodes (the President, the First Lady),
      traverse all shared edges (scenes), filter by temporal boundary (the MS scandal), compare
      relationship states before and after. That shape does not exist in a spreadsheet. It does
      not exist in a wiki. It exists in a graph, the way a join exists in a relational database.
      You cannot fake it with a better spreadsheet any more than you can fake a SQL join with
      a cleverer filing cabinet.
      <br><br>
      The deepest architectural decision is subtler than the database choice. It is the separation
      of <em>identity</em> from <em>state</em>. A Character node represents who someone
      is&mdash;their canonical identity, their aliases, their persistent attributes. An
      EventParticipation represents who they are <em>in a specific moment</em>&mdash;their
      emotional state, their goals, what they did. This separation is what allows a knowledge
      graph to answer &ldquo;how did this character change over time?&rdquo; without overwriting
      their history. Documents flatten time into the most recent edit. Graphs preserve every state
      a character has ever occupied. That is the difference between a reference document and a
      knowledge structure.

    headline: "What We Believe"

      These are not design principles. They are architectural commitments that determine
      what the system can and cannot do. Each one closes a door on purpose.
    principles:
      - title: "Graphs, not documents"
        quote: "&ldquo;A story is a web of typed relationships. A spreadsheet is a list.&rdquo;"
        body: >
          The entertainment industry creates the most complex narrative structures in human
          culture and manages them in Google Sheets with tabs for each season. We built a graph
          database because stories are webs of relationships, not rows of data. The tool should
          match the shape of the problem.
      - title: "Dual temporal indices"
        quote: "&ldquo;Narrative time is not audience time. Track both or track neither.&rdquo;"
        body: >
          Every flashback exploits the gap between fabula and syuzhet. Every cold open depends on
          it. We maintain both temporal indices because the questions writers actually ask require
          both timelines, and a system that collapses them into one is not simplifying. It is
          losing information.
      - title: "Human-in-loop adjudication"
        quote: "&ldquo;The AI is the research assistant. You are the editor.&rdquo;"
        body: >
          Every extraction is editable. Every entity is mergeable. Every relationship is
          overridable. We designed for a workflow where machines propose and humans decide,
          because narrative interpretation is not a classification task. It is an editorial
          judgment, and editorial judgments belong to editors.
      - title: "Zero drift"
        quote: "&ldquo;Hallucination is an engineering problem, not an inevitability.&rdquo;"
        body: >
          Schema constraints. Evidence grounding. Confidence gating. Contrastive resolution.
          We treat hallucination the way databases treat corruption: with layers of defence
          that make it progressively harder for bad data to survive. Same input, same graph,
          every time. Accuracy over speed, always.
      - title: "Edges are first-class content"
        quote: "&ldquo;Connections between events matter as much as the events themselves.&rdquo;"
        body: >
          Other tools extract entities. We extract the relationships between them&mdash;causal,
          thematic, emotional, temporal&mdash;because narrative meaning lives in the edges. A
          character is a node. A character&rsquo;s arc is a path through typed edges over time.
          If your tool only gives you nodes, it is giving you a cast list, not a story.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # 5. THE WORK SO FAR — converted from stats to prose
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # VOICE STRATEGY: The original was a stat grid. The voice primer
  # says: "Stats appear WITHIN prose as punchlines, not freestanding
  # callouts." The intro text about choosing the hardest test cases
  # was already the best material — promote it to the core of a
  # prose section, weave the numbers in as evidence.
  #
  # COMPRESSION: 726 entities, 80+ episodes, 5 series, 0 entity
  # drift — these numbers appear as punchlines within sentences,
  # not as callout cards. The reader encounters them as proof
  # points in an argument, not as a dashboard.

    headline: "Five Series. Zero Shortcuts."
    body: >
      We chose the hardest test cases we could find, deliberately. Star Trek: The Next Generation
      for alias complexity and multi-species naming conventions&mdash;a universe where a single
      character might be referenced as &ldquo;Lieutenant Worf,&rdquo; &ldquo;Worf, son of Mogh,&rdquo;
      or &ldquo;Ambassador Worf&rdquo; across different episodes, and the system must understand
      these are the same entity without being told. Doctor Who for identity continuity across
      regeneration&mdash;a protagonist who changes face, personality, and actor while remaining
      canonically continuous. The West Wing for sheer density of political relationships, where
      726 canonical entities interact across four seasons of overlapping storylines. Motherland:
      Fort Salem for military hierarchy and supernatural world-building that bends the rules of
      a realist knowledge graph. Indiana Jones for cinematic set pieces spanning decades of
      in-world time.
      <br><br>
      Five series. More than 80 episodes processed end to end. 726 canonical entities&mdash;characters,
      locations, objects, organisations&mdash;extracted, resolved, and linked with zero entity drift
      across the entire corpus. Same input, same graph, every time. Deterministic, reproducible,
      auditable. We did not choose easy shows and claim generality. We chose the shows that would
      break a brittle system and built a system that did not break. If the architecture survives
      Worf&rsquo;s three canonical names and the Doctor&rsquo;s fourteen canonical faces, it will
      survive your show.

  # logical consequence of the architecture: if you have a graph,

  # The prose about game studios, legal asset manifests, and
  # Season 4 onboarding is the argument's natural conclusion —

    headline: "When Your Show&rsquo;s Structure Is a Graph, Adaptation Becomes a Query"
    body: >
      A knowledge graph of narrative is not a story bible. It is a foundation. When your show&rsquo;s
      narrative structure is a queryable graph, things that used to require months of manual work
      become operations. &ldquo;Give me every character with more than three scenes in the same
      location&rdquo; is a graph traversal that feeds directly into game level design. &ldquo;Find
      all unresolved character conflicts&rdquo; is a query that tells the writers&rsquo; room
      where to focus next. &ldquo;Export every entity, relationship, and constraint for legal
      review&rdquo; is a single command, not a three-week project.
      <br><br>
      When a new writer joins in Season 4, they do not read a 200-page PDF and hope they absorbed
      it. They query the graph: &ldquo;Show me this character&rsquo;s complete arc, every
      relationship they have, and every unresolved thread attached to them.&rdquo; When legal needs
      an asset manifest for a licensing deal, they export structured data from the graph, not a
      folder of documents that someone assembled by hand. When a game studio licenses the IP, they
      receive a knowledge graph with typed relationships and temporal indices, not a binder and a
      phone call with the showrunner.
      <br><br>
      This is not a vision statement. It is an architectural consequence. If the data is structured,
      queryable, and temporally indexed, these capabilities do not need to be built. They are already
      implied by the structure. The only question was whether anyone would build the structure.
      We built it.
