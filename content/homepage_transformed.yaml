# Homepage — Infocom Voice Transformation
# =========================================
#
# STRATEGIC ARGUMENT (the one argument, prosecuted throughout):
# Stories are knowledge graphs. The entertainment industry manages them
# as documents. This is architecturally wrong, and we built the thing
# that's right.
#
# COMPETITIVE FOIL (equivalent to Infocom's "pixel-based games"):
# The spreadsheet. The wiki. The PDF story bible. The binder.
# These are the blocky arcade sprites of narrative production.
#
# AUDIENCE:
# Smart, literate, frustrated professionals who create the most complex
# narrative structures in human culture and manage them with the tools
# of a dentist's office. They will read five hundred words if those
# words respect their intelligence.
#
# VOICE REGISTER:
# The Intelligent Friend. Aspirational, not adversarial. Trusts the
# reader. Flatters their intelligence. Makes a case, doesn't make a pitch.
#
# STRUCTURAL APPROACH:
# Provocative reversal headline → long-copy resolution → sustained
# argument → compressed evidence → call to action → closing mantra.
# Stats and feature grids replaced with prose and specificity.

# HEADLINE: Provocative reversal.
# Surface reading: You're insulting our work product.
# Resolved reading: The stories in it are fiction. The bible itself
# should be fact — but a document that someone updated last Thursday
# can't be a source of truth for 726 characters across four seasons.
# That's not a reference. That's an act of faith.
#
# The word "fiction" is doing double duty in a domain where fiction
# is the product. The audience will feel the friction immediately.

    Not the stories in it. The bible itself. A document that someone updated
    last Thursday, that claims to track every character, location, and relationship
    across four seasons of television, that has no way to verify its own accuracy
    and no mechanism to update when the next script revision lands&mdash;that's not
    a source of truth. That's an act of faith. And faith, in a writers' room
    on Episode 7 of Season 4, is how you lose the plot. Literally.
    <br><br>
    Fabula is the context engine that replaces faith with structure. Upload your scripts
    and it extracts every character, every relationship, every location, every narrative
    thread into a searchable knowledge graph&mdash;one that updates itself, can't drift,
    and answers questions no spreadsheet will ever answer. We didn't build a better
    story bible. We built what a story bible should have been all along.

  # 1. THE ARGUMENT (replaces "proof-points" stats block)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # INFOCOM PRINCIPLE: Sustained prose argument, not stat callouts.
  # The five-part body copy architecture: the headline resolution
  # happened in the hero. Now we make the product argument.
  #
  # INFOCOM PRINCIPLE: Compression and implied vastness.
  # Instead of saying "726 canonical entities," we show one
  # character's graph trace and let the reader infer the other 725.

    headline: "The Most Complex Narratives in Human Culture Are Managed in Google Sheets"
    body: >
      Consider what a showrunner actually manages. Four seasons of television. Seven
      hundred characters&mdash;from the President of the United States to the bartender
      who appeared once in a cold open and might come back in Season 5. Thousands of
      relationships between those characters, each of which has a history, a trajectory,
      and a current state. Every location carries the weight of everything that happened
      there. Every established fact is a constraint on every future script.
      <br><br>
      Now consider the tools. A spreadsheet with tabs for each season. A wiki that
      was accurate in February. Binders. Whiteboards. The script coordinator's memory.
      When someone in the writers' room pitches a storyline and the room goes quiet
      because nobody's sure if they did something like it in Season 2&mdash;that silence
      is an infrastructure failure. Not a memory failure. An infrastructure failure.
      <br><br>
      There is a reason the question &ldquo;which episodes is Toby's ex-wife
      in?&rdquo; can't be answered by a spreadsheet. It's the same reason &ldquo;show
      me every character who has scenes with both the President and the First Lady,
      and how those relationships changed after the MS scandal&rdquo; can't be answered
      by a wiki. These are graph operations. They require following typed edges across
      temporal boundaries, filtering by relationship state, aggregating across episodes.
      They require a knowledge graph. We built one.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # 2. THE EVIDENCE (replaces "social-proof" section)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # INFOCOM PRINCIPLE: "Show, don't tell." The Hitchhiker's ad
  # reproduced actual game output as evidence. The ad became the
  # product for a few seconds. We do the same: show one specific,
  # evocative detail from the live graph that implies the whole system.
  #
  # INFOCOM PRINCIPLE: Genre pastiche as proof of product.
  # The copy should demonstrate what it claims. If we claim the graph
  # can answer questions, we should show a question being answered.

      Fabula knows this because it read the scripts. It also knows that her relationship
      with President Bartlet preceded his political career, that her death in the Season 2
      finale reverberates through four subsequent episodes across two seasons, and that her
      name appears in dialogue delivered by eleven different characters. It knows the
      emotional arc of every conversation she had with the President, what she believed in
      each one, and how those beliefs shifted. It can tell you all of this in 87 milliseconds.
      <br><br>
      This is one character out of 726. We've processed four seasons of <em>The West
      Wing</em> end to end&mdash;every character, every relationship, every location, every
      narrative connection&mdash;into a searchable, browsable knowledge graph. Not a mockup.
      Not a demo rigged to impress. A live production system you can explore right now, the
      way you'd explore any tool you were considering trusting with your show.

  # 3. THE BIGGER PICTURE

  # The "beachhead" framing is kept but given more conviction.

    body: >
      At its core, Fabula is a pipeline for creating accurate, structured knowledge at scale
      from unstructured sources. We started with screenplays because they're the hardest test
      case we could find&mdash;consistent formatting, clear entities, brutal temporal complexity,
      and an audience that will notice if you get a single detail wrong. If the architecture
      survives four seasons of <em>The West Wing</em> with zero entity drift and 90% extraction
      accuracy validated against human annotation, it'll survive your domain too.
      <br><br>
      But we're not in a hurry to leave entertainment. The industry that creates the most
      complex narrative structures in human culture deserves tools that understand what it's
      actually building. Right now, every major studio is spending millions on proprietary
      content metadata systems that are manually curated, siloed per show, and not embedded
      in creative workflows. We think that's about to change.

# CTA — THE CLOSING MANTRA

# INFOCOM PRINCIPLE: The closing mantra is not a tagline.
# It's a ritual — challenge, declaration, romantic promise,
# personal invitation. "Step up to Infocom. All words. No pictures.
# The secret reaches of your mind are beckoning."
#
# Fabula equivalent: challenge (step into), declaration (the
# architectural claim), romantic promise (your story's structure
# was always there), personal invitation (now you can see it).
