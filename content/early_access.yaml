# Early Access Page — v2 Voice Primer Rewrite
# =============================================
#
# V2 PRIMER ASSIGNMENTS:
# Unique thesis: Partnership intake, not waitlist. Every project
#   reviewed individually. The form is the content.
# Signature show: None (the form itself is the demonstration)
# Signature demonstration: Form quality — the specificity of
#   the intake signals the seriousness of the response.
# Emotional movement: Warmth → respect → specificity → confidence
#
# COMPETITIVE FOIL: Not applicable. This page doesn't argue
# against anything. It invites.
#
# RHYTHMIC MODES USED:
# Hero: Staccato confession — short declarative lines that
#   build trust through honesty about the process.
# Form intro: Sustained argument (brief)
# CTA: Magnanimous declaration
#
# V1 → V2 CHANGES:
# - Hero body given staccato rhythm. V1 was a sustained-argument
#   paragraph. V2 opens with short declarative lines: "We could
#   have built a waitlist." / "Instead, we review every project."
#   The staccato rhythm creates warmth through candour.
# - Confirmation section slightly warmed — the person just
#   did something meaningful, acknowledge it specifically.
# - Shows listed in footnote updated to reflect current catalog.
# - Footer mantra varied per v2 Section 12.

# HEADLINE: Preserved from v1. "This Is Not a Contact Form.
# It's an Application." — the provocative reversal works
# because "application" implies selectivity, which the body
# reframes as individual attention.
#
# BODY: Shifted to staccato rhythm. V1 was a single
# sustained paragraph. V2 uses shorter declarative lines
# to build trust through candour: "We could have built a
# waitlist. We didn't. Here's what we do instead."
#
# GEAR: Warmth → respect.

    We could have built a waitlist. Collect emails, drip-feed updates,
    announce general availability in six months.
    <br><br>
    Instead, we review every project individually. When you tell us what
    you&rsquo;re working on, someone on the team reads it&mdash;not a routing
    algorithm, not a lead-scoring model, a person who understands narrative
    production. We respond with specifics: what Fabula can do with your scripts
    today, what it can&rsquo;t do yet, and whether the timing is right.
    <br><br>
    That takes longer than a waitlist. It also means that when we say
    &ldquo;we&rsquo;re ready for your project,&rdquo; we mean it.

  # Preserved from v1. The form is the content. The intro sets

  # V1 → V2: Confirmation body slightly warmed. "We've Got It"

      We work with showrunners, writers&rsquo; rooms, development executives,
      researchers, and the occasional investor who understands that narrative
      infrastructure is a category, not a feature. Whatever brought you here,
      start by telling us what you&rsquo;re building. That&rsquo;s the conversation
      we want to have.

        Your project, not your email&mdash;that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re
        reviewing. Someone on the team will read what you&rsquo;ve told us
        within a few days and come back with a specific assessment&mdash;not
        a generic &ldquo;thanks for your interest&rdquo; email, but an honest
        read on what Fabula can do with your material and what onboarding
        looks like. In the meantime, the live catalog is the best way to
        see the system thinking.
