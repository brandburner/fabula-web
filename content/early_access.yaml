# Early Access Page — Application and Partnership Intake
# =====================================================
#
# VOICE REGISTER: Early Access Voice.
# A warmer, more collegial variant of the Intelligent Friend.
# This page should feel like an invitation to a private conversation,
# not a transactional form. The reader is being welcomed into something
# selective, not sold something mass-market. Think: a club acknowledging
# a potential new member, not a SaaS funnel processing a lead.
#
# STRATEGIC ARGUMENT (page-level):
# Fabula is in private beta because the work is hard and the standards
# are high. Every project gets individual attention. This isn't a
# waitlist — it's a partnership intake. The form is the content.
#
# STRUCTURAL APPROACH:
# Minimal. Hero (provocative reversal + warm resolution) → Form
# (the action) → CTA (soft alternative) → Closing mantra.
# Don't over-write it. The form IS the page.
#

# HEADLINE: Provocative reversal with warmth.
# Surface reading: Sounds gatekeeping, exclusive, even a little
# intimidating. "Application" implies you might not get in.
# Resolved reading: We take each project seriously enough to
# review it individually. We're not mass-producing demos or
# running a drip campaign. We're building relationships with
# production teams. The friction of "application" is actually
# respect — for the work and for the people doing it.
#
# The body resolves the tension immediately: this is about
# individual attention, not exclusivity for its own sake.

    We could have built a waitlist. Collect emails, drip-feed updates,
    announce general availability in six months. Instead, we review every
    project individually. When you tell us what you&rsquo;re working on,
    someone on the team reads it&mdash;not a routing algorithm, not a
    lead-scoring model, a person who understands narrative production.
    We respond with specifics: what Fabula can do with your scripts today,
    what it can&rsquo;t do yet, and whether the timing is right.
    <br><br>
    That takes longer than a waitlist. It also means that when we say
    &ldquo;we&rsquo;re ready for your project,&rdquo; we mean it.

  # The form is the content. The intro text sets the tone:
  # collegial, specific, conversational. Not a preamble to
  # a form — an opening move in a dialogue. The confirmation
  # section acknowledges that they've done something meaningful
  # and tells them exactly what happens next.

      We work with showrunners, writers&rsquo; rooms, development executives,
      researchers, and the occasional investor who understands that narrative
      infrastructure is a category, not a feature. Whatever brought you here,
      start by telling us what you&rsquo;re building. That&rsquo;s the conversation
      we want to have.

        Someone on the team will review your project within a few days.
        We&rsquo;ll come back with a specific assessment&mdash;not a
        generic &ldquo;thanks for your interest&rdquo; email, but an honest
        read on what Fabula can do with your material and what the onboarding
        looks like. In the meantime, the live catalog is the best way to see
        the system thinking.

# CTA — SOFT ALTERNATIVE
# ===========================================================
# "Not Ready to Apply?" echoes the "application" framing from
# the hero. No pressure, but the language keeps the register
# consistent: this is something you apply for, not something
# you sign up for. The body gives a low-commitment alternative
# that still moves the reader deeper into the product.
