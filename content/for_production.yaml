# For Production — v2 Voice Primer Rewrite
# ==========================================
#
# V2 PRIMER ASSIGNMENTS:
# Unique thesis: The gap between narrative complexity and production
#   tooling is an infrastructure failure, not a workflow problem.
#   Four specific failures, diagnosed.
# Signature show: Star Trek: The Next Generation
# Signature demonstration: Worf's three canonical names resolved
#   to a single entity — alias resolution as production workflow.
# Emotional movement: Diagnosis → recognition → demonstration → confidence
#
# COMPETITIVE FOIL (this page's instance):
# The script coordinator's memory. Institutional knowledge that
# walks out the door when someone leaves the show.
# (Homepage owns "the shared drive nobody trusts." About owns
# "Netflix EKG as expensive document." Benchmarks owns
# "self-reported metrics.")
#
# RHYTHMIC MODES USED:
# Hero: Sustained argument
# Pain points: Scenic (second person, present tense — feel the pain)
# Evidence: Narrative drift → wonder
# CTA: Magnanimous declaration
#
# V1 → V2 CHANGES:
# - Signature show changed from TWW to TNG throughout
# - Mrs. Landingham evidence section replaced with Worf
#   alias resolution demonstration
# - Pain point scenarios rewritten in scenic mode
# - "726" removed (Benchmarks owns it), "87ms" compressed
#   (Benchmarks/homepage own it)
# - "most complex narratives in human culture" removed
#   (homepage owns that formulation)
# - "dentist's office" removed (homepage CTA voice primer owns it)
# - Footer mantra varied per v2 Section 12

  body: >
    Start with hundreds of characters. Give each one a history, a set of
    relationships, a trajectory that shifts across four seasons. Add thousands
    of established facts&mdash;any one of which constrains every future script.
    Layer in temporal dependencies, thematic arcs, locations that carry the weight
    of everything that happened in them.
    <br><br>
    Now manage all of it in a spreadsheet.
    <br><br>
    That is how you lose the plot. Not metaphorically. Structurally. The
    complexity of what a writers&rsquo; room builds has outgrown the tools it uses
    to track what it&rsquo;s built. Fabula is the context engine that closes
    the gap&mdash;a knowledge graph that reads your scripts, extracts everything
    in your show, and answers questions no document ever will. It updates
    itself. It cannot drift. And it already works.

    label: "The Diagnosis"
    headline: "Four Infrastructure Failures Nobody Talks About"
    intro: >
      These are not workflow problems. They are not memory problems. They are
      infrastructure failures&mdash;the predictable result of managing graph-structured
      data in flat documents. Every production encounters them. Almost none recognises
      what they actually are.
    scenarios:
      - title: "The Silence in the Room"
        context: "(writers&rsquo; room)"
        pain: >
          It&rsquo;s Tuesday. Someone pitches a storyline and the room stalls. Not
          because the idea is bad, but because nobody can confirm whether you did
          something like it in Season 2. You look around. The showrunner is thinking.
          The script coordinator is scrolling through a spreadsheet that hasn&rsquo;t
          been updated since before the hiatus. Nobody says &ldquo;no,&rdquo; but
          nobody says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; either. That silence costs you the momentum
          of the pitch and maybe the storyline itself. It is not a memory failure.
          It is a system that cannot answer &ldquo;did we do this before?&rdquo;
          across four seasons of television.
        solution: >
          Fabula indexes every arc, character journey, and thematic thread across
          every season. The question &ldquo;have we done this?&rdquo; becomes a
          query that returns in milliseconds, with episode numbers attached.

      - title: "The Eighty-Episode Rewatch"
        context: "(production)"
        pain: >
          A character from Season 1 is coming back. You need her title, her
          relationships, what she knew and when she knew it. You open the story
          bible. The story bible has a paragraph about her that was last edited
          eighteen months ago by someone who left the show. You open the scripts.
          There are eighty of them. The honest answer is that nobody remembers,
          and the current method for finding out is reading eighty scripts cover
          to cover. That is not a research method. It is an admission that no
          research method exists.
        solution: >
          Every character has a canonical profile built automatically from the
          scripts&mdash;every appearance, every relationship, every piece of
          information they encountered, timestamped to the episode. Lookup
          takes seconds.

      - title: "The Expensive Contradiction"
        context: "(script supervision)"
        pain: >
          You&rsquo;re reading tomorrow&rsquo;s pages. A character mentions an
          event that contradicts something established two seasons ago. You catch
          it in prep. Good. If you hadn&rsquo;t, it would have reached the stage,
          and the difference between catching it now and catching it in dailies is
          tens of thousands of dollars. But the real failure happened earlier: the
          system that stores your show&rsquo;s canon has no mechanism to detect
          when new material violates it. Detection depends entirely on you
          remembering every established fact across every produced episode.
        solution: >
          Fabula tracks every established fact, every relationship state, every
          piece of canon across your entire series. Contradictions surface
          before they reach the stage&mdash;because the system knows what
          has been established and can compare it against what is being written.

      - title: "The Friday Afternoon Read"
        context: "(production coordination)"
        pain: >
          Legal needs a complete list of every real-world brand, location, and
          licensed music cue mentioned in this season&rsquo;s scripts. By Monday.
          You sit down with a highlighter and start reading. Every script, cover
          to cover. You build the spreadsheet by hand. This happens every season.
          Sometimes it happens twice. The information was always in the scripts.
          The problem is that no system existed to extract it.
        solution: >
          Every entity&mdash;object, location, brand mention, music cue&mdash;is
          extracted and cataloged automatically. Filterable asset inventories
          generated on demand. The Friday read becomes a Friday query.

    intro: >
      Fabula reads your scripts and builds a living knowledge graph of everything
      in your show. Not a summary. Not a spreadsheet. A queryable, connected,
      self-updating record of every entity and every relationship.
    steps:
      - number: 1

        title: "Upload Your Scripts"

          Characters, locations, relationships, objects, themes&mdash;extracted and
          connected automatically. Every entity gets a canonical profile. Every
          relationship gets a history. The graph updates when new scripts arrive.

          and the First Officer.&rdquo;
          &ldquo;How did Worf&rsquo;s loyalties shift after he joined DS9?&rdquo;
          These are graph queries. They return in milliseconds.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # 3. THE EVIDENCE — WORF
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # V2 PRIMER: This is For Production's signature demonstration.
  # Worf's three canonical names live here and nowhere else.
  #
  # RHYTHMIC MODE: Narrative drift → wonder.
  # Opens with the specific production problem (a character
  # referenced three different ways) and lets the story unspool
  # into what the graph reveals about identity resolution.
  # The wonder moment: the system understands that rank changes,
  # cultural contexts, and career transitions produce different
  # names for the same person — the way a script coordinator
  # does, but without the coordinator.
  #
  # GEAR: Transitions from Diagnosis (1) to Wonder (2).

    label: "Tested on Real Television"
    headline: "Lieutenant Worf. Worf, Son of Mogh. Ambassador Worf. One Person."
    body: >
      The script says &ldquo;The Captain.&rdquo; Later it says &ldquo;Picard.&rdquo;
      Later still, someone calls him &ldquo;Jean-Luc.&rdquo; A human reader knows
      these are the same person. A spreadsheet does not. An entity extraction
      system that creates three separate entries for the same character hasn&rsquo;t
      solved the problem&mdash;it&rsquo;s automated the problem.
      <br><br>
      Fabula resolves aliases against a living canonical graph. &ldquo;Lieutenant
      Worf,&rdquo; &ldquo;Worf, son of Mogh,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ambassador
      Worf&rdquo; collapse to a single canonical entity&mdash;one node carrying
      the full history of a character whose name changes with rank, with cultural
      context, with career. The system understands that a promotion doesn&rsquo;t
      create a new character. A Klingon naming convention doesn&rsquo;t create a
      new character. An ambassadorial appointment doesn&rsquo;t create a new
      character. It understands this across seven seasons and 178 episodes, with
      zero drift.
      <br><br>
      That&rsquo;s what entity resolution looks like at production scale. Not a
      string match. Not a similarity threshold. A system that understands narrative
      identity the way your script coordinator does&mdash;except it doesn&rsquo;t
      leave the show in Season 3.
