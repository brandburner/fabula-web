# For Production — Voice Transformation
# ======================================
#
# STRATEGIC ARGUMENT:
# The entertainment industry builds the most complex narrative structures
# in human culture and manages them with the tools of a dentist's office.
# This is not a workflow problem. It is an infrastructure failure.
# Fabula is the infrastructure that should have existed all along.
#
# COMPETITIVE FOIL:
# The spreadsheet. The binder. The script coordinator's memory. The wiki
# that was accurate in February. These are not story bibles. They are
# acts of faith dressed up as systems.
#
# AUDIENCE:
# Showrunners, writers, script supervisors, development executives.
# Zero jargon. These people build 726-character narrative universes
# under production deadlines and manage them with tab-separated values.
# They will read long copy if it diagnoses their situation precisely.
#
# VOICE REGISTER:
# The Intelligent Friend, but in diagnostic mode. Not "we feel your pain"
# but "here is why your infrastructure is broken, and here is what we
# built instead." Confident, conspiratorial, precise.
#
# KEY ANTI-PATTERN AVOIDED:
# Empathy-first SaaS voice. "We know how frustrating it is..." is
# therapy-speak. Fabula diagnoses. It does not empathise.

# HEADLINE: "How to Lose the Plot" — double meaning from the lexicon.
# Surface: sarcastic self-help parody, the kind of headline that makes
# a showrunner stop scrolling because it sounds like a joke about their
# actual Tuesday.
# Turn: a literal description of what happens when you manage narrative
# in spreadsheets. You lose the plot. Not metaphorically. Structurally.
#
# BODY: Diagnostic, not empathetic. We do not say "you've been there."
# We describe what a showrunner actually manages (the scale) and then
# contrast it with the tools (the absurdity). The gap between the
# complexity and the infrastructure IS the argument.

  headline: "How to Lose the Plot"
  body: >
    Start with seven hundred characters. Give each one a history, a set of
    relationships, a trajectory that shifts across four seasons. Add thousands
    of established facts&mdash;any one of which constrains every future script.
    Layer in temporal dependencies, thematic arcs, locations that carry the weight
    of everything that happened in them.
    <br><br>
    Now manage all of it in a spreadsheet.
    <br><br>
    That is how you lose the plot. Not metaphorically. Structurally. The
    complexity of what a writers&rsquo; room builds has outgrown the tools it uses
    to track what it&rsquo;s built. Fabula is the context engine that closes
    the gap&mdash;a story bible that reads your scripts, builds a knowledge graph
    of everything in your show, and answers questions no spreadsheet will ever
    answer. It updates itself. It cannot drift. And it already works.

  # 1. INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES (replaces empathy-first pain_points)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # VOICE PRINCIPLE: Each scenario is a DIAGNOSIS, not a consolation.
  # The framing headline shifts from "Sound Familiar?" (empathy) to
  # a declarative statement about what these failures actually cost.
  #
  # Each "pain" field diagnoses the architectural reason the problem
  # exists, not the emotional experience of having it.
  # Each "solution" field states the fix as an inevitability, not
  # a sales pitch.
  #
  # The word "infrastructure" is deliberate. It reframes what feels
  # like a memory problem or a workflow problem as a systems problem.
  # That reframing is the entire sale.
  # ---------------------------------------------------------

    label: "The Diagnosis"
    headline: "Four Infrastructure Failures Nobody Talks About"
    intro: >
      These are not workflow problems. They are not memory problems. They are
      infrastructure failures&mdash;the predictable result of managing graph-structured
      data in flat documents. Every production encounters them. Almost none recognises
      what they actually are.
    scenarios:
      - title: "The Silence in the Room"
        context: "(writers&rsquo; room)"
        pain: >
          Someone pitches a storyline and the room goes quiet. Not because the
          idea is bad, but because nobody can confirm whether you did something
          like it in Season 2. That silence is not a memory failure. It is an
          infrastructure failure. A system that cannot answer &ldquo;did we do
          this before?&rdquo; across four seasons of television is not a story
          bible. It is a hope.
        solution: >
          Fabula indexes every arc, character journey, and thematic thread across
          every season. The question &ldquo;have we done this?&rdquo; becomes a
          query that returns in milliseconds, with episode numbers attached.

      - title: "The Eighty-Episode Rewatch"
        context: "(production)"
        pain: >
          A character from Season 1 is coming back. What was their title? Who
          did they share scenes with? What did they know, and when did they know
          it? The honest answer is that nobody remembers, and the current system
          for finding out is rewatching eighty episodes of television. That is
          not a research method. It is an admission that no research method exists.
        solution: >
          Every character has a canonical profile built automatically from the
          scripts&mdash;every appearance, every relationship, every piece of
          information they encountered, timestamped to the episode. Lookup
          takes seconds.

      - title: "The Expensive Contradiction"
        context: "(script supervision)"
        pain: >
          A character references an event that contradicts something established
          two seasons ago. The script supervisor catches it in prep, or does not
          catch it until dailies. The difference between those two outcomes is
          tens of thousands of dollars. But the real failure happened earlier:
          a system that stores canon in documents has no mechanism to detect
          when new material violates it. Detection depends on a human
          remembering every established fact across every produced episode.
          That is not quality control. It is a prayer.
        solution: >
          Fabula tracks every established fact, every relationship state, every
          piece of canon across your entire series. Contradictions surface
          before they reach the stage&mdash;because the system knows what
          has been established and can compare it against what is being written.

      - title: "The Friday Afternoon Read"
        context: "(production coordination)"
        pain: >
          Legal needs a complete list of every real-world brand, location, and
          licensed music cue mentioned in this season&rsquo;s scripts. Somebody
          sits down and reads every script cover to cover, building a spreadsheet
          by hand. This happens every season. Sometimes it happens twice. The
          information was always in the scripts. The problem is that no system
          existed to extract it.
        solution: >
          Every entity&mdash;object, location, brand mention, music cue&mdash;is
          extracted and cataloged automatically. Filterable asset inventories
          generated on demand. The Friday read becomes a Friday query.

    intro: >
      Fabula reads your scripts and builds a living knowledge graph of everything

      self-updating record of every entity and every relationship.

  # 3. THE EVIDENCE (replaces stats grid)
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # VOICE PRINCIPLE: Convert stats to prose. Weave the numbers into
  # a narrative paragraph. Show one specific example (Mrs. Landingham)
  # and let the reader infer the system.
  #
  # INFOCOM PRINCIPLE: Compression and implied vastness. Instead of
  # listing "726 characters, 87ms, zero errors" as callout cards,
  # we tell the story of one character query and let the reader
  # multiply by 725.

    body: >
      We processed four seasons of <em>The West Wing</em> end to end. Every
      character, every relationship, every location, every narrative connection.
      The result is a knowledge graph of 726 canonical entities and the thousands
      of relationships between them.
      <br><br>
      Pick any one. Mrs. Landingham, for instance. Fabula knows she was mentioned
      in three episodes before she appeared on screen. It knows her relationship
      with President Bartlet preceded his political career, that her death in the
      Season 2 finale reverberates through four subsequent episodes across two
      seasons, and that her name appears in dialogue delivered by eleven different
      characters. It can trace the emotional arc of every conversation she had
      with the President and tell you how those conversations shifted over time.
      It returns all of this in 87 milliseconds. That is one character out of 726.
