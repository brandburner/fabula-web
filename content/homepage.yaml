# Homepage — v2 Voice Primer Rewrite
# ====================================
#
# STRATEGIC ARGUMENT (the one argument, prosecuted throughout):
# Stories are knowledge graphs. The entertainment industry manages them
# as documents. This is architecturally wrong, and we built the thing
# that's right.
#
# V2 PRIMER ASSIGNMENTS:
# Unique thesis: Your story bible is a document. It should be a graph.
# Signature show: The West Wing
# Signature demonstration: Mrs. Landingham temporal analysis
# Emotional movement: Provocation → recognition → wonder → invitation
# What the reader leaves with: The category exists. The product exists. Go look at it.
#
# COMPETITIVE FOIL (homepage instance):
# The story bible that someone updated last Thursday.
# The shared drive nobody trusts. The room going quiet.
# (Other pages own other foil instances — the script coordinator's
# memory, Netflix EKG, monolithic prompts, self-reported metrics.)
#
# AUDIENCE:
# Smart, literate, frustrated professionals who create complex
# narrative structures and manage them with inadequate infrastructure.
# They will read five hundred words if those words respect their
# intelligence. The homepage assumes no prior knowledge of Fabula.
#
# VOICE REGISTER:
# The Intelligent Friend. Aspirational, not adversarial. Trusts the
# reader. Flatters their intelligence. Makes a case, doesn't make a pitch.
#
# EMOTIONAL GEARS USED:
# Gear 1 (Diagnosis): Hero + Section 1. "Here's what's broken."
# Gear 2 (Wonder): Section 2. "Here's what becomes visible."
# Gear 3 (Conviction): CTA. "This is what stories deserve."
#
# STRUCTURAL APPROACH:
# Provocative reversal headline → long-copy resolution → compressed
# problem diagnosis → sustained wonder demonstration → conviction CTA
# → closing mantra.
#
# V1 → V2 CHANGES:
# - Section 1 tightened from three paragraphs to two. Diagnosis is
#   faster and more specific. New headline.
# - Section 2 (Mrs. Landingham) restructured to lead with wonder.
#   The discovery is the headline. The system capabilities are
#   implications, not features. Leans into Gear 2.
# - Section 3 ("Beachhead") removed. It was investor-speak on a
#   page for showrunners. The architecture-generalises argument
#   belongs on Platform and About. The homepage's job is: the
#   category exists, the product exists, go look at it.
# - CTA rewritten with conviction (Gear 3) instead of soft invitation.
# - Footer mantra is the site-wide default (homepage is the canonical
#   source of the full mantra per v2 primer).

# ===========================================================
# HERO
# ===========================================================
# HEADLINE: Provocative reversal. Preserved from v1 — it's the
# strongest piece of copy on the site.
#
# "Fiction" does triple duty: pejorative (unreliable), descriptive
# (the genre), domain-specific (the audience makes fiction).
#
# BODY: Tightened. The resolution ("Not the stories in it.")
# lands in four words. The accumulating clauses build the case.
# "Act of faith" / "lose the plot" is the turn. The second
# paragraph is the product statement — compressed, confident,
# one clean architectural claim.
#
# GEAR: Diagnosis (1). The hero's job is provocation and
# recognition. Wonder comes later.

  headline: "Your Story Bible Is Fiction"
  body: >
    Not the stories in it. The bible itself. A document that someone updated
    last Thursday, that claims to track every character, location, and relationship
    across four seasons of television, that has no way to verify its own accuracy
    and no mechanism to update when the next script revision lands&mdash;that's not
    a source of truth. That's an act of faith. And faith, in a writers' room
    on Episode 7 of Season 4, is how you lose the plot. Literally.
    <br><br>
    Fabula is the context engine that replaces faith with structure. Upload your
    scripts and it extracts every character, every relationship, every location,
    every narrative thread into a searchable knowledge graph&mdash;one that updates
    itself, can't drift, and answers questions no document ever will. We didn't
    build a better story bible. We built what a story bible should have been all along.

  # 1. THE PROBLEM
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # RHYTHMIC MODE: The Scenic (Section 9).
  # V1 and the first v2 draft both used sustained argument here.
  # The scenic mode puts the reader inside the moment instead
  # of describing it analytically. Second person, present tense.
  # The pain is felt, not explained.
  #
  # The shift from the hero (sustained argument, diagnostic) to
  # this section (scenic, experiential) creates rhythmic relief.
  # The reader moves from being told to being immersed.
  #
  # GEAR: Diagnosis (1), delivered through immersion rather
  # than analysis.

    headline: "The Room Goes Quiet. Nobody Remembers Season 2."
    body: >
      It's Tuesday. Someone pitches a storyline and the room stalls — not because
      the idea is bad, but because nobody can confirm whether you did something like
      it two seasons ago. You look at the wiki. The wiki was last updated before the
      holiday hiatus. You look at the shared drive. The shared drive has three
      competing versions of the character list and no indication which one is current.
      You look at the script coordinator. The script coordinator is thinking hard and
      not making promises.
      <br><br>
      That silence is not a memory failure. It is an infrastructure failure. The
      question &ldquo;did we do this before?&rdquo; is a graph operation &mdash; it requires
      traversing relationships across temporal boundaries, filtering by story state,
      aggregating across episodes. Your tools can't do that. Not because they're bad
      tools. Because they're the wrong kind of tool. A knowledge graph answers that
      question in milliseconds, because the question has a shape that only a graph
      can hold. We built one.

  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # 2. THE EVIDENCE — MRS. LANDINGHAM
  # ---------------------------------------------------------
  # V2 PRIMER: This is the homepage's signature demonstration.
  # Mrs. Landingham lives here and nowhere else on the site.
  #
  # V1 → V2 CHANGES:
  # - Restructured to lead with wonder (Gear 2) rather than
  #   capability description. V1 opened with "Fabula knows
  #   this because it read the scripts" — a feature statement.
  #   V2 opens with the discovery itself: what the graph
  #   reveals about Mrs. Landingham that no human reader
  #   assembled. The system's capabilities are implications
  #   of the discovery, not the point.
  # - "Her presence in the graph is larger than her presence
  #   on screen" promoted from buried line to the structural
  #   centre of the section. This is the wonder moment — the
  #   thing that makes a reader feel the excitement of what
  #   a knowledge graph can do, not just the embarrassment
  #   of what a spreadsheet can't.
  # - Removed "Not a mockup. Not a demo rigged to impress."
  #   Defensive language doesn't belong in the wonder section.
  #   Let the catalog speak for itself.
  # - "726" does not appear. Per v2 primer, the homepage
  #   implies scale through compression ("hundreds more")
  #   rather than announcing a number. 726 as a featured
  #   punchline lives on the Benchmarks page.
  #
  # GEAR: Wonder (2). This section should make the reader
  # feel something — the thrill of structural understanding,
  # the sense that the graph reveals patterns that were always
  # in the scripts but that no individual reading could surface.

    headline: "Mrs. Landingham Was Mentioned in Three Episodes Before She Appeared on Screen"
    body: >
      Her name appears in dialogue delivered by eleven different characters. Her
      relationship with President Bartlet preceded his political career. Her death
      in the Season 2 finale reverberates through four subsequent episodes across
      two seasons — not just as grief, but as a structural event that deflects
      the arcs of everyone who knew her. The graph can trace the emotional wake
      of that single death through the entire narrative: which characters changed
      direction, in which episodes, and how those changes compound.
      <br><br>
      Her presence in the graph is larger than her presence on screen. That's the
      pattern that emerges when you stop managing a show as a collection of documents
      and start treating it as the connected structure it always was. We've processed
      four seasons of <em>The West Wing</em> end to end — every character, every
      relationship, every narrative connection — into a knowledge graph you can
      explore right now. You'll find patterns like this everywhere. Connections that
      were always in the scripts, waiting for an infrastructure that could surface them.

# CTA — CLOSING WITH CONVICTION
# ===========================================================
# RHYTHMIC MODE: Magnanimous Declaration (Section 9).
# After the scenic problem section and the wonder-driven
# evidence section, the CTA shifts to the quietest, most
# confident mode. No diagnosis. No foil. No argument. Just
# a clear, warm, declarative statement and an invitation.
# The confidence comes from the absence of argument — the
# page has already made the case.
#
# GEAR: Conviction (3).
