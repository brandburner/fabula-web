# Sample section demonstrating all YAML conventions
# -------------------------------------------------
# This is an annotated reference, not a live content file.
# Copy and adapt when adding new sections to any content/*.yaml page.

# BACKGROUND ALTERNATION:
#   Sections alternate page/surface. Hero bookends use 'hero'.
#   Pattern: hero → page → surface → page → surface → ... → hero (CTA)

# HTML ENTITIES:
#   Smart quotes: &ldquo; &rdquo; (double), &lsquo; &rsquo; (single)
#   Dashes: &mdash; (em dash), &ndash; (en dash)
#   Emphasis: <em>italics</em>, <strong>bold</strong>

# EXAMPLE: A feature_grid section (icon+title+body cards)
- id: context-engineering
  type: feature_grid
  background: surface          # alternates with previous section
  label: "THE ARCHITECTURE"   # small-caps label above headline
  headline: "&ldquo;Context Engineering&rdquo; &mdash; Not Just Another AI Pipeline"
  intro: >-
    Most AI tools treat scripts as flat text. Fabula decomposes narrative
    into a typed knowledge graph with five core node types, dual temporal
    indices, and hallucination-guarded extraction.
  features:
    - icon: users              # Lucide icon names, kebab-case
      color: primary           # primary | green | blue | violet | cyan | rose | orange
      title: "Characters"
      subtitle: >-
        Canonical identity separated from transient participation state.
        Zero entity drift from pilot to series finale.
    - icon: calendar
      color: green
      title: "Events"
      subtitle: >-
        Dual temporal indices &mdash; fabula (story-internal) and syuzhet
        (discourse order) &mdash; enable flashback-aware traversal.
    - icon: map-pin
      color: blue
      title: "Locations"
      subtitle: >-
        Every location carries the weight of everything that happened there.
        A corridor on the <em>Enterprise</em> isn&rsquo;t just a set.
    - icon: box
      color: violet
      title: "Objects"
      subtitle: >-
        Artefacts, documents, weapons &mdash; tracked across scenes with
        narrative significance annotations.
    - icon: git-merge
      color: cyan
      title: "Connections"
      subtitle: >-
        The assertion explaining <em>why</em> two events connect,
        not just <em>that</em> they connect. Nine typed edge categories.

  # OPTIONAL: blockquote adds a serif pull-quote below the grid
  blockquote: >-
    &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t invent this framework. G&eacute;rard Genette
    described it in 1972. We&rsquo;re the first to implement it as
    production-grade software.&rdquo;

  # OPTIONAL: blog_links for source references
