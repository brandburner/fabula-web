  canonical_name: Airbnb
  description: Airbnb runs a platform where hosts rent flats and other properties
    to short-term guests. Amanda lists her flat on Airbnb, but guests remain locked
    out, blocking access and sparking an urgent logistical crisis during childcare
    arrangements among the group.

  canonical_name: Alpha Mums
  description: An informal local clique of dominant neighborhood mothers led by Amanda
    (commonly referred to in the text as both the "Alpha Mums" and "The Mums"). They
    gather in Amanda's social spaces (kitchen or the cafe's prime table) to coordinate
    childcare swaps and barters while policing community status through gossip, judgmental
    looks, performative politeness, drinking, and exclusion. Members including Anne
    and Sunita frequently instigate rumors (e.g., about Liz and Melissa's husband),
    which ostracize figures like Julia and reinforce the group's gatekeeping role
    in community support and social hierarchy.

  canonical_name: Costa Coffee
  description: Costa Coffee brands coffee stands in office receptions, delivering
    beverages to workers during daily routines. Paul scans its menu while arguing
    childcare with Julia, his distraction underscoring the stand's role as a mundane
    commercial anchor in tense corporate-personal overlaps. Helinka appears nearby,
    tying the brand to on-site staffing and service amid the scene's family crisis.

  canonical_name: Facebook
  description: Facebook operates as a social media platform where users post personal
    incidents, such as Kevin's breastfeeding mishap, to spread gossip and manage public
    relations. Liz urges Kevin to share the story there for visibility. She also uses
    it to search for and track down past partners and their wives, turning it into
    a tool for personal investigations amid social tensions.

  canonical_name: Julia, Liz, and Kevin's Gang
  description: Julia, Liz, and Kevin form this informal trio on the street outside
    Amanda's house after she rejects Julia's childcare plea and slams the door. They
    negotiate a Thursday/Friday childcare swap to support each other amid exclusion
    from the alpha mums' network. Kevin offers awkward solidarity; Liz delivers defiant
    truth. The group turns humiliation into practical community, with children and
    a pilfered iPad trailing behind. Julia shifts from approval-seeking to building
    her own support system.
  sphere_of_influence: Informal Parental Childcare Network
- fabula_uuid: org_dc14e4e6eea3
  global_id: null
  canonical_name: Local Mothers' Group
  description: The Local Mothers' Group consists of neighborhood women, including
    Amanda, Liz, Sunita, and Anne, who assemble in Amanda's kitchen to share meals,
    exchange gossip, and provide comfort during personal crises like Anne's distress.
    They enforce community norms by observing Julia's mishaps, participating in her
    public shaming over stolen leftovers, and upholding a social hierarchy that polices
    behavior and childcare duties. Their collective scrutiny exposes hypocrisies and
    generates pressure on outsiders like Julia.

  canonical_name: Women in Construction Awards
  description: Julia organizes this awards ceremony that honors women in the construction
    industry. Peter Mandelson hosts the event, which she mentions to highlight her
    professional connections and demanding schedule amid childcare chaos. It signals
    her elite networks and status in a high-profile corporate gig.
