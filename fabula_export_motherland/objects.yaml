  canonical_name: Stalled Coin-Operated Horse Ride
  description: A battered coin-operated horse ride sits outside a row of shops near
    a laundrette. It grinds to a halt mid-ride, sparking a child's piercing scream
    that shatters Julia's fragile composure amid her childcare struggles. Liz restarts
    the machine by jamming two pennies into the coin slot, instantly soothing the
    child and easing the mounting chaos.
  purpose: Delivers brief rocking rides for children in exchange for inserted coins.
  significance: Sparks Julia's mascara-streaked public breakdown under childcare pressure,
    drawing Liz's calm intervention with pennies. This small fix defuses the crisis,
    reveals Julia's vulnerability, and cements Liz as a practical ally, shifting Julia
    toward genuine support over social facades.
