    thrusting the child into the group's transactional social web. This moment underscores

    possible stroke—which draws sympathetic responses like 'Oh, no!' from Sunita and
    Julia. The group comforts Anne amid her worry, then turns vigilant, glancing at
    and judging Julia as she sneaks leftover spaghetti. They watch silently as Amanda
    offers Julia an omelette in a ritual of charity-laced punishment, responding to
    the announcement and amplifying the social tension. Their presence enforces group

    maternal qualities needed for her kids' upbringing. This positions Helinka as
    a dependable building staffer whose everyday role sparks debate over family logistics
    and class boundaries.

    hands the children to Julia outside her flat and speeds away, after which tensions
    among the children (including Charlie and Manus) erupt into a fistfight that forces
    Julia into crisis management. In another scene the same children travel with Julia

    a stalled coin-operated horse until Liz slips two pennies into the machine to
    quiet one child. They function as a single recurring, unruly child group in the
