  title: Leo Vigorously Defends Josh's Deception Amid Bartlet's Ethical qualms
  description: As they walk from the portico into the Oval Office late at night, President
    Bartlet probes Leo about Josh's elaborate ruse to lure pollster Joey Lucas to
    D.C.—fabricating a polling trip on 'subsurface agriculture' (beets). Bartlet expresses
    discomfort with the deception, but Leo staunchly defends Josh's ingenuity as essential
    amid plummeting polls and crises, challenging Bartlet on trusting his top aide.
    To evade suspicion over their clandestine seven-person meeting, Leo urgently relocates
    them to the basement, underscoring the administration's heightened secrecy and
    pragmatic ruthlessness.

  title: Bartlet Overrides Jake, Orders Embassy Evacuation and Marines
  description: In the Oval Office briefing on the Haitian coup, after learning of
    Dessaline's disappearance and military encirclement, Leo proposes evacuating non-essential
    embassy personnel. Jake warns it signals U.S. doubt in the Dessaline government,
    risking diplomatic fallout. Bartlet decisively overrides, declaring no such government
    exists, invokes recent Colombian deaths for urgency, and commands evacuation of
    non-essentials, Marines to the embassy, and briefing Fitzwallace—escalating U.S.
    response, unifying the team under his authoritative resolve amid dual crises of
    MS fallout and international peril. This turning point setups intensified standoffs.

    and joins Toby, C.J., and pacing Sam amid cratering polls. Sam demands a raw,

  title: Bartlet Defies Risks, Orders Dessalines' Embassy Entry
  description: In the Oval Office, Leo urgently briefs President Bartlet on Dessalines'
    flight to the U.S. embassy after his bodyguards are shot, likely concealed in
    Jake Bratt's car trunk. Robbie warns of geopolitical peril—elevating Bazan via
    standoff and hostage risks—but Leo counters with moral imperatives of U.S.-backed
    elections. Bartlet overrides objections, ordering the gates opened; confirmation
    thrusts America into direct confrontation with the Haitian junta, a pivotal escalation
    underscoring his resolve amid MS scandal and reelection doom.

  title: Josh Presses Ritter on Tobacco Funding Amid Haitian Absurdity
  description: Outside a D.C. building, Josh and Senator Ritter briefly marvel at
    the Haitian crisis's surreal escalation—the president-elect smuggled into the
    U.S. embassy in a car trunk—eliciting Ritter's weary resignation. Josh swiftly
    pivots to lobbying for a $30M Justice Department appropriations bill stalled in
    Ritter's committee to fund the landmark tobacco lawsuit. Ritter reveals the chairman's
    tobacco donor loyalty, a tight 8-7 against vote crossing party lines (including
    ideological holdouts Warren and Rossiter), underscoring congressional gridlock
    and moneyed interests thwarting the administration's justice agenda amid broader
    crises. Ritter's parting pat signals polite deflection, highlighting Josh's futile
    outreach in a multi-front political siege.

  description: In the Outer Oval Office, Charlie and Mrs. Landingham review papers
    when Charlie offers a car discount. She sharply rejects it, citing White House

  title: Charlie Delivers Crushing News of Mrs. Landingham's Death to Leo
  description: In the Outer Oval Office, Charlie stands frozen, gripping the phone
    receiver with dread as Leo enters. Calmly but devastatingly, Charlie reveals a
    drunk driver struck Mrs. Landingham's new car at high speed, killing her instantly.
    Leo, stunned into silence, wavers in shock, his iron resolve cracking; hoarsely
    confirming Charlie bears the burden alone, he staggers past her empty desk—poignantly
    symbolizing irreplaceable loss—and exits to the veranda. This intimate gut-punch
    pierces the White House's frenzy over MS polls and Haiti, humanizing Leo's vulnerability
    and escalating emotional stakes as a tragic turning point amid political chaos.
