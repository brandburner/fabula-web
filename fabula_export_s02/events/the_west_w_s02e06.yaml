  title: C.J.'s Razor-Sharp Press Deflections on Konanov, Mitchell, and Lame Ducks
  description: 'In the packed Press Briefing Room, C.J. Cregg masterfully controls
    the narrative: she flatly denies Vasily Konanov''s meetings with high-level officials
    like Nancy McNally, limiting him to low-stakes Balkans advisors. She skewers Senator-elect
    Mitchell''s threats to block the Test Ban Treaty with a confident pledge of ratification
    and a biting quip about his diminished power. Evasively batting away Danny Concannon''s
    persistent probing on a lame duck session—insisting no discussions she''s aware
    of—she buys the White House precious time amid diplomatic chaos and ratification
    deadlines. This poised performance reveals C.J.''s strategic deflection skills,
    advancing the administration''s messaging while causally priming leaks and Toby''s
    urgency.'

  - 'REPORTER 1ST: "Senator elect Morgan Mitchell''s going to announce... he''ll block
    a vote on the Test Ban Treaty..." C.J.: "We''ll have a fully ratified, comprehensive
    Test Ban Treaty... we really don''t care what condition his body is in when we
    do."'
  - 'DANNY: "Has the President considered ordering a lame duck session so the current
    Senate can vote on the Treaty?" C.J.: "No... That I''m aware of."'

  title: Josh Smirks at C.J.'s Press Trap and Rallies Donna to Intercept
  description: In Josh's office, as he collects files while watching C.J.'s briefing,
    Josh smirks, declaring she 'walked into it'—a logical trap where denying the President
    hasn't considered a lame duck session forces her to inquire, making him consider
    it. Donna probes for clarity amid his muddled explanation, quipping it's 'stupid';
    Josh concedes it was clearer in his head. With her briefing wrapping, they bolt
    down the hallway to intercept C.J., showcasing their razor-sharp banter, instinctive
    teamwork, and proactive crisis management amid the Test Ban Treaty's mounting
    chaos. This setup beat bridges C.J.'s deflections to unified staff strategy, injecting
    levity into high-stakes urgency.

  title: 'Senior Staff Frenzy: Lame Duck Treaty Push and Leo''s Discipline'
  description: In a chaotic Oval Office briefing, Sam, Josh, and C.J. rapidly outline
    a intricate Senate committee reshuffle to slot incoming opponent Mitchell onto
    Foreign Relations, countering his treaty-blocking threat. Toby bursts in, rallying
    for an immediate lame duck session with moral urgency on nuclear proliferation
    outweighing risks of defeat or Senate backlash. Amid overlapping arguments, an
    exasperated Bartlet demands aspirin and a weapon. Leo imposes order, greenlighting
    leadership checks, nose counts, and a strategic leak, then in his office rebukes
    inefficiency with a strict two-page summary rule, assigning Toby and Sam Hill
    meetings. This pivotal strategy crystallization heightens stakes, revealing internal

  title: Bartlet's Aspirin Desperation Exposes Chaos; Leo Imposes Memo Discipline
  description: Amid frenzied Oval Office crosstalk on Senate reshuffles for the Test
    Ban Treaty, President Bartlet quips about the circus-like disarray, then demands
    aspirin and a weapon from Charlie to endure the overload. Leo redirects to concrete
    actions—nose counts, leaks—before confronting staff in his office with a Washington
    Post editorial slamming inefficiency. He mandates two-page summaries initialed
    by him for all Oval briefings, restoring order. This comic pressure valve humanizes
    Bartlet, reveals administrative fractures under deadline strain, and pivots to
    disciplined execution as a turning point in the ratification push.

    deniable leak attribution, revealing her media mastery, their flirtatious tension,
    and advancing the White House's desperate ratification ploy amid Senate defections.

  title: Leo Greenlights 'States of Concern' and Forces C.J. to Consider Danny's Access
  description: In the Communications Office, Leo demands a quick briefing from C.J.
    on the State Department's push to rebrand 'rogue nations' as 'states of concern'
    for diplomatic goodwill amid Test Ban Treaty pressures. She pitches it as a low-cost
    optics win, securing his approval despite her wry admission it'll make her 'feel
    stupid.' Leo then reveals reporter Danny Concannon's request for exclusive access
    to a three-part feature, igniting C.J.'s fierce resistance due to recent Post
    editorials savaging the staff. Leo overrides her, ordering a Presidential consult,
    exposing the White House's tightrope between foreign policy finesse and battered
    press relations in a high-stakes crisis.

  title: Margaret's Slow Protest Quashed; Leo and Josh Devise Konanov 'Accident'
  description: Margaret's deliberate two-fingered typing, solidarity in Donna's OSHA
    protest, frustrates Leo until his glare forces compliance. Josh bursts in with
    the drunken Ukrainian diplomat Konanov squatting in his office, prompting Leo's
    bold 'Dalai Lama ploy' for an accidental Presidential meet to secure treaty leverage.
    They debate ethics of lame-duck maneuvering amid Marino's potential defection,
    then Josh recruits a protesting Donna as the low-level 'beard' for the ruse—reframing
    her rebellion as opportunity—pivoting internal discord into diplomatic ingenuity
    under ticking deadlines.
