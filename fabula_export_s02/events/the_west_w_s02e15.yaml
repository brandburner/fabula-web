  title: Griffith's Witty Online Marijuana Risk Takedown
  description: In a live online Q&A from her office, Surgeon General Millicent Griffith
    fields user questions on marijuana's fertility and cancer risks with sharp medical
    accuracy, humor, and sarcasm. She dismisses permanent sterility claims as reversible
    at most, denies conclusive cancer evidence, but bluntly warns of respiratory dangers
    from smoking—urging Pixelad to stash his bong. This unapologetic candor defies
    White House memos, revealing her principled defiance and igniting the political
    crisis as the inciting revelation of administrative fracture.

  - |-
    MODERATOR: JerseyGirl wants to know if marijuana can make you sterile.
    DR. GRIFFITH: Is this JerseyGirl asking the question, or JerseyBoyfriend?
  - 'DR. GRIFFITH: Okay. Well, there''s no evidence so far that marijuana has a permanent
    effect on the male or female reproductive systems. A few studies have suggested
    that heavy marijuana use may have an effect on male testicular function, but that
    effect would be reversible.'
  - 'DR. GRIFFITH: No conclusive study to date has shown that it does. However...
    and this is a big however... cellular, genetic and human studies all suggest that
    the smoke from pot is a risk factor in acquiring respiratory disease. So, if Pixelad
    wants to be able to walk up a flight of stairs without throwing up, he should
    put the bong back in the closet behind the Allman Brothers albums where it belongs.'

  title: Gillette Strategy Banter Shattered by Ginger's Call
  description: In Sam's office, a rubber ball signals Toby's summons, drawing Sam
    into their ritualistic banter laced with strategy. Toby outlines the ploy to appoint
    Seth Gillette to the Social Security Commission—securing labor and seniors' buy-in
    while neutralizing a foe—anticipating refusal and plotting a feigned non-ask if
    needed. Their competitive rapport peaks with ball tosses, but Ginger's urgent
    interruption for a phone call yanks Sam away mid-discussion. Toby defiantly hurls
    the ball once more as Sam unflinchingly answers 'Charlie!', embodying the ceaseless
    tug between camaraderie and crisis in the West Wing's pressure cooker.

  title: Josh Watches C.J. Deflect Katie's Drug Policy Trap
  description: In the waiting room outside the Surgeon General's office, Josh Lyman
    sits tensely on a couch, eyes glued to the TV broadcasting C.J. Cregg's press
    briefing. Reporter Katie aggressively frames Surgeon General Griffith's pro-marijuana

    rejecting the characterization and clarifying Griffith's remarks as a personal
    medical opinion on health effects, not policy—subtly underscoring Bartlet's firm
    support amid the crisis. This pivotal beat reveals Josh monitoring the communications
    team's deft damage control, heightening his stakes as he prepares to demand Griffith's

  title: Bartlet’s Steel Tariff Firebrand Impeded by Leo’s Crisis Reveal
  description: Exiting Air Force One at Andrews, a fired-up President Bartlet schools
    Charlie on Japan’s steel dumping fueling protectionism, warning of Smoot-Hawley
    echoes and massive taxpayer costs per job saved. Impulsively set to address the
    press directly—revealing his hands-on economic instincts amid mounting pressures—Bartlet
    is intercepted by Leo, who bars questions due to Ellie’s six-hour-old on-record
    defense of the Surgeon General. Leo admits withholding the news mid-flight to
    avert disaster. Stunned and silent, Bartlet enters the limo, his policy momentum
    crushed by incoming family-political fallout, pivoting the narrative to personal
    crisis.

    Bartlet to abandon his press engagement. Leo's tactical delay in disclosure, to
    prevent mid-flight distraction, underscores the escalating personal stakes, transforming

    with casual small talk about her medical school interests, invoking Zoey's mention
    of oncology or neurology to build rapport amid her anxiety over the impending
